The Clevians are a lost race loosely based on all the other lost races, & you may be one without even knowing it! Since the Clevians were forced into hiding thousands of years ago, powerful hypnotic injunctions have supressed their self-awareness. Our camp uses arcane mind-techniques to recover your memories of the lost Clevian paradise. Enter our great pulsing dome filled with swirling balloons and lights and we will feed you a crispy pickle on a stick, a Clevian symbol of hospitality or even lust… practice the lost art of Knackling, or take a turn on the Abrasion Wheel. These and dozens more of newly-recovered Clevian customs await you. Try them all!",

As you circle the ring, you notice each arch of the ‘henge leads you down a different path, a different place of discovery, and rebirth. Each arch standing 9’ tall, black and yielding an inkling to what lies beyond. At night, the flat black shapes light up in a myriad of stars. You wander from camp to camp having some part of you reborn each time. Each time you exit, the center stage has something new going on to entertain you as you reflect on your rebirth. How could you come out the same person that entered? OV is now accepting applications from theme camps to join the Village. Applications will be accepted until the end of June. Please visit our site, read the mission statement, and e-mail us if you wish to join. Los Angeles residents preferred for organizational purposes, but any camp could be accomodated. Applications received later than June 30th may still receive consideration, based on community decision to do so.",
