For 10 years, we have produced exquisite themed bronze pendants that are embellished and personalized with colorful resin inlay. For Da Vinci's Workshop, we are proud to present the historical 1627 Florin coin, from the Republic of Italy. Originally struck in gold, ours is gold colored in rich bronze. Hand carved in green wax by Sumner Silverman, one side displays the beautiful \"fleur-de-lis\" symbol. The reverse, is St. John the Baptist, outlined in negative space cells for the resin. BM 2016 is carved on the side of the coin. This project and the stories we learned about other jewelry for the last two years, was the inspiration for the book \"Jewelry of Burning Man\", published in 2015. We teach every day for 3 hours per day.",

Our stage, is the SAVAGE ARENA - an environment that breathes with its performers and cradles its listeners. Find shelter from the wind, dust and sun inside its robust structure and flexible skin. Find an elevated perch to watch the sun rise and set through the horizon. Find a hammock to sleep or a daybed to rest. Find a bocce ball, give it a toss. Find a beer to shotgun, and some tits to motorboat. Find a jungle gym and climb. Find a wheel with questionable dares, and spin it. And while you're exploring, listen to our music, watch our lights, find your friends, and lose your minds -- together.",

Le Kafé may be the coziest landing spot on playa at any hour in 9 o'clock sector. \r\n\r\nMorning: Bring a cup and enjoy organic coffee and tea along with pastries and biscotti.  Sit down in shade and jump start your body and mind.  \r\nAfternoon: shady napping abounds in our \"flounge\" (lounge of many futons).  Cool off in our yurt, large hammock or porch swing.  Down tempo grooves provide a gentle backdrop day and night.  Relax.  Sip a cold one.  Get a back rub.  Soak your feet in a cool medicinal bath.  \r\nEvening: sunset transforms Le Kafe into an informal cocktail lounge where you can enjoy playing with our many lighted toys or our 7-circuit lighted labyrinth.  Late night fires warm your bones as you stumble back to town.   After playa nights, blankets and pillows abound in the lounge. Snuggle. Slumber.  Repeat.\r\nCome see how we provide one of the best landing pads in Black Rock City.",

Exploring the mystical realms within and without, we stalk the many-faced prey of the One - we are the flock and the fledging, the church and the people, the dungeon and the steeple. We explore the ever-emerging edge of intimate truth and togetherness. Before, during, and after, we dance.\r\n\r\nBy day, we play with reverent abandon and reckless devotion in honor of each other - and what we create when we turn our heartbeams to a dynamic and fluid center. We serve homemade kimchi by the arched fingerful and deliver fresh, happy juices into keen mouths. By night, we play with spontaneity and serendipity, drunk only on the magic of connection and juice. The dome becomes a place to mellow out and venture into the frontierlands of mind, body, and spirit where we, the Hunting Party seek the We in You.",

While we fully support those groups, we choose to instead explore sex positivism by creating a safe event space for healthy dialogue of human sexuality. Our mission is to share ideas and philosophies that aid in the discovery of our sexual selves. We have created, and are always improving, a dedicated workshop and event space that is a platform for our lifelong journey of learning.",

Over the next 5 years, we will be investigating each of these strange lands, then reconvening back here to tell of our adventures.\r\n\r\nWhile our travels instilled in us a breadth of knowledge, the catharsis of adventure has left us with a desire to share our experiences with the world. Through workshops, lectures, performances, and merry making, our mission is to educate you in the ways of these 5 mysterious and foreign lands.  In addition to daily and nightly events, we will also be serving food and drink which we have discovered along the way.  And what of your travels?  Do you have stories to share with us?

The context of Burning Man serves as an amplifier to these ancient Tantric techniques. The collective ambition towards freedom present during Burning Man is unique. It erases differences between individuals and supports the Tantric effort of transcending all false dualities. From regular morning energetic practices to one-of-a-kind ceremonies and ritual, Tantra Mantra embraces and promotes the change towards a new human agreement.

    "description": "The Sacred Song Teahouse is a temple for devotional singing on the playa.\r\n\r\nThere are many traditions of devotional singing, sometimes known as bhajans or kirtan, which help to quiet the mind so that the heart can open to the divine, allowing us to taste the blissful reality that is our true nature. Rather than being a performance in which the audience listens to musicians, it is a participatory spiritual practice in which everyone is encouraged to sing and express their inner joy.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Song Teahouse is a Burning Man camp dedicated to creating and maintaining a serene temple oasis for joining our voices and diving into the Divine... together. We welcome the keepers of tea wisdom to join us in our temple space to sooth our throats with their mystical infusions. We welcome musicians to join us on stage and have a safe and secure place for them to store their instruments during the Burn. Together we create Magic!",

This work requires the masculine as well; Everyone is welcome.\r\n\r\nAt Naked Heart we recognize the need to embrace both the light and the dark in our journeys. When we pursue the light we use movement, the senses, sensuality, sexuality and connection.  This beckons us in and brings the light of awareness back into the bodies we have vacated. We are particularly interested in the seat of power and intention housed in our bodies. To go there fully requires confronting our shadows. We embrace those as well as we dive into shame, fear, anger, unsavory memories from this life and past lives, and disempowering images of our bodies. Welcome home.",

Horny campers knew that two horns are better than one, and an unlimited number of horns is better than two. They loved Twinkii the twini-corn and both of his magical horns and his wish-hole.

With that in mind, we would like to use this mystical opportunity to host our fellow burners as Planetarium Aquarium Presents: Suzanne's Swan Lake Swamp!\r\n\r\nGet set up at the Burner Bog welcome station, lounge swampside or live a little and test out Suzanne's patented Swamp Launcher -- diving into the world's only cuddle-puddle of mystical misfit creatures -- likely right where you belong.\r\n\r\nBe sure to join us swampside Wednesday for happy hour(s) with only the best summer jams -- and don only your finest playa formal for Thursday night's grand finale: THE SWAN LAKE BALL!!!",

The LEDs change over time as they flow up, allowing the viewer to \"go back in time\" by viewing the colors of previous playa passers-by.

Our team consists of multiple scientists, philosophers, physicians, and engineers who give lectures on planetary sciences, biology, neuroscience, and more.
