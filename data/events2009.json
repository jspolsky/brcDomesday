Johnny 1/05/09 transitioned (passed away)on our Guru's birthday (Parmahansa Yogananda).  We will chant to Radha & Krishna next to his memorial for Johnny, his wife & for all that have passed away since the last burn. Hug & hold Suzanne (Johnny's wife) & chant aum. Suzanne plans to spend the night at The Temple in honor of their anniversary. Company to keep her warm & safe would be appreciated. \"Johnny was the most wonderful husband in all of the Universes.\"- Quote from Suzanne his unbiased wife. Dr.Lynch took his last breath in his meditation chair after they had cuddled & made out on their bed, with one of their cats cuddling with them. Seated in his chair, Suzanne placed her left hand on his heart & held his left hand in her right & repeated 3x's, \"Baby I love you so much! baby I love you so much! Divine Mother loves you! Guruji loves you!\" Her husband slipped through the cracks of our health care system...or he would be here today. Check the website to read more about him & their beautiful love story.",

    "description": "\"Common Tongues\" explores current perspectives regarding sexual behavior, perceived risk factors and communication in our polyamorous, highly sexualized culture.  How do we negotiate what we do—and want to do—with our partners?  What factors come into play when making decisions regarding \"safety\"?  What unspoken agreements do we hold with ourselves and our partners?  Are those agreements ever broken...and if so, why?  \r\n\r\nDue to the highly intimate nature of this topic, I'm requesting that only men who have sex with men participate.  I understand that gender exclusion is controversial, but it's my goal to create a safe, healing space where men can bond on their common physical and sexual experiences and feel free to relate experiences and questions in a common psychic arena.\r\n\r\nThis is not a lecture or therapy group but an open discussion for people to share their experiences, viewpoints, and feelings in a safe, non-judgmental/non-shaming space.\r\n\r\nVapor (the facilitator) is a San Francisco filmmaker with an educational background in psychology and communications.",

We’re not delving into the fundamental Christian underscore of the piece; we’re in it for the pun.  Our camp is a garden of plant life that is illuminated from within; a “Garden of DeLights”.  Come share a cocktail and dance to the DJs spinning from our potting shed.  Our garden has illuminated croquet and several unique environments to explore.  BYODebauchery.",

This year we are featuring “REDNECK TANK TOPS” along with other very sexy naughty costumes. The “REDNECK TANK TOPS” can be worn as tops or crotchless undies. You can get one new costume any time you want and as many times as you want. The only requirement is that you bring back a new person who has not gotten a costume every time you get a new costume and they need to do the same. You can keep your costume, return it or donate new costumes to share with other people. Every day at 9:30 AM volunteers clean up the boutique and put out new costumes. They get first pick of the new costumes. Don’t miss out…become a volunteer.",

You probably feel your mind is noisier, not more silent, than it was before you started. Your body is restless, ill at ease, and — if you do manage to endure the hour — stiff and painful.\r\n\r\n     By contrast, this meditation begins with at least one phase of activity. This allows you to loosen up your body and to unburden your mind. Then you are able to move naturally from stress to deep relaxation, silence and stillness.\r\n     And the effect doesn't finish there; with regular practice you will be able to carry an inner centering with you in your regular day, wherever you are and in whatever you are doing.",

Delighted to have surprise guests at their small, mystical village of Kabala, they alert the chief. Carried out on a traditional West African throne, the chief comes to greet the crowd and welcome them to his village. Speaking in his tribal language of Mende, he teaches the crowd something of his ancestry and asks if they would like to be inducted into their secret society. The ritual begins, and in addition to the initiation, the chief has decided that they will “pull the devils” in honor of their new visitors. As drumming and traditional Sierra Leonean instruments thump throughout the “village”, masked dancers emerge, pulling the visitors into the devil’s parade. Traditional bamboo sticks are given away so that the visitors can play along with the staccato rhythm of the devil’s dance song. Finally, the devil emerges: both frightening and powerful, good and mischievous, the devil plays with the deep playa visitors. A dance ensues, mixing traditional Sierra Leonean beats with modern house and hip-hop.",

    "description": "Black Rock Solar is committed to creating, implementing and demonstrating a sustainable model for providing alternative energy at low- or no-cost to underserved communities. \r\n\r\nBlack Rock Solar started as a project at Burning Man to power part of Black Rock City. We’re named after the Black Rock Desert in which the Burning Man event takes place, a reflection of our deep roots in the Burning Man community.\r\n\r\nThe staff and board of Black Rock Solar (BRS) will be on site at the Culture Labs daily to discuss what it is that BRS does, and how to get 'plugged in' to alternative energy yourself.\r\n\r\nConsult the experts, have a glass of tea, hang out in the shade. Discover what the other Outreach groups (BRAF, Regionals, BWB) are up to. \r\n\r\nWe'll have a map of Black Rock City available so you can add your camp with your alternative energy installation to it, and see what the other denizens of our fair city are up to this year.",

Dress in blood red, bring bloody marys, and prepare to dance the darkness away to bring in a blood red sunrise set never to be forgotten!\r\n\r\nSit down in one of the relaxing arm chairs at the Heartbeat Amplifier Project and contemplate a sculpture of the human heart. As you place your hands on the arm rests, hear the sound of your heartbeat suddenly throb out of massive bass heavy speakers, echoing into the sky and deep within your core.  A warm light pulses against your face, strobing your eyes with mesmerizing intensity.  A subsonic transducer vibrates your body to the rhythm of your pulse.  All this in complete synchronicity with your heartbeat and in orchestra with the beats of your friends as you relax into sensory overload and trance-like meditation.  Others lay on the vibration platform near the chairs to take in the symphony of human biorhythms as you connect with your own heart and with those around you.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Heartbeat Amplifier and Abraxas Blood Red Sunrise Party!!  \r\n\r\nFriday 4am-8am at the Heartbeat Amplifier Project, between the Man and the Temple.\r\n\r\nContact Hitch for more details: yohitch(at)gmail(dot)com",

Have you ever made a joke about \"Line Camp\" thinking it was a clever quip as opposed to a joke older than alkaline dust? Are you just -not- funny and as a result, get no sex? If any of this sounds like it could be you, or if you just yearn to be like those assholes that rove the playa verbally assassinating anyone who cocks a goggle at them funny, this is the class for you! This class is aimed at sculpting megaphone users into viable, humorous, and entertaining participants in the burning man experience (at the expense of others, obviously), instead of simply arming abusive retards with a loudspeaker. The class includes a seminar followed by a field trip to a bar for lubrication before descending upon the Playa for practical application. Taught by Christopher Ory of Interpretive Arson (MC of Dance Dance Immolation & Fire Idol) & Indigo of Death Guild (ThunderDome's Bullhorn Maestro & Founder of The United States Snark Special Forces Assault Squad), TA: EdRabbit of Interpretive Arson (Usually the last one to get the joke, usually the joke, certified megaphone operator)",

You can choose either GI glazed carrots or GI southern style green beans!\r\n\r\nWe're hoping to have coffee as well, but I guess we'll just have to wait and see if we can get the supplies in order.  Under the assumption that we will have coffee it's of course BYOC (Bring Yer Own Cup!) although we'll be providing disposable plates and utensils for the food (I know I know please no yelling at me about that) since it's a little harder to ask people to bring their own plates and utensils.\r\n\r\nWhile relaxing with your meal we'll be showing oldschool propaganda films from WWII and the days of the Cold War.  Our theme involves living on a military base long after an atomic war... get it?  Awesome.  \r\n\r\nFirst come first serve, but we're doing it in waves so showing up a little later than 9pm may be to your advantage!",

Sexy playa Car Washers will be ‘buffing’, ‘sudsing’, ‘rinsing’ and ‘waxing’ the car to maximum sexiness. After passing through the wash, park your mutant vehicle and join in on the fun! The Art Car Wash will be operated daily by Disorient, but we invite all playa participants to visit Disorient throughout the week and lend a hand with towels, misters, buffy fuzzy things or just yourselves....

They allow us to run upright and we can outrun virtually every other species on Earth over long distance - perfect for hunting! We celebrate our large gluteus maximus ‘big ass’ muscles with a series of three fun runs: Wed, Thu & Fri 6:30 p.m. Tri-tip BBQ Fri. Assemble 6:30 at the Big Ass Fun Run sign, depart at 6:45 (weather permitting). Not fast, not far, but you'll break a happy sweat as we run around the playa together. If you’re a runner, or just looking for a good sweat, get your ass down to the Rhythm Wave Camp Annex to join the fun. Immediately after the Friday run, we'll enjoy a small bite of tri-tip fresh off the BBQ - the spoils of the hunt! Nicest ass (male & female) eat first! Stay after for ecstatic dance with Rhythm Wave at 7:30. www.rhythmwave.org",

This is a non-ejaculatory practice that stimulates and spreads erotic energy through the body.  It is very hot, but it isn’t sex; there is no sexual interaction between the giver and receiver except for the massage, and boundaries will be respected.  The workshop focuses on the male body, though women can give massage. Come early; latecomers and spectators will not be admitted, and we've had to turn people away every year.",

To become planetized is to adopt new ways of thinking\r\nthat reflect a holistic viewpoint between humankind and the planet.\r\nA planetized view is one able to conceptually grasp that this\r\nplanet is just one of many, from one solar system, among billions of\r\nstar systems, among billions of galaxies.

    "description": "Outdoor screenings starting at Twilight\r\n\r\nWednesday night we will be showing cult classics that question our evolution and we are honored to present a new and challenging movie, \"Fierce Light – When spirit meets action\", by acclaimed filmmaker Velcrow Ripper. In Fierce Light Velcrow Ripper, filmmaker and spiritual seeker, journeys through the world exploring what Martin Luther King called “Love in Action” and Gandhi called “Soul Force”.\r\n\r\nIn exploring how lasting change can be motivated by love and realized in action, Velcrow interviews spiritual activists such as Thich Nhat Hanh, Desmond Tutu, Daryl Hannah, Julia Butterfly Hill, and others. Through his cinematic journey, Velcrow discovers what Paul Hawken (author “Blessed Unrest”) describes as the largest global movement in history – thousands of individuals and organizations connected by a shared commitment to compassionate, positive action. There is hope for our evolution.\r\n\r\nVelcrow Ripper intends to be at Burning Man shooting footage for the third movie in his trilogy to be entitled “Evolve Dissolve: Another World is Here“. If at Burning Man, Velcrow will be on hand during the screening of Fierce Light – When spirit meets action.\r\n\r\nPrior to screening \"Fierce Light – When spirit meets action\", we will screen “Humanity Ascending” with Barbara Marx Hubbard at twilight. This documentary features author and futurist Barbara Marx Hubbard and offers a vision toward our birth as a new humanity – Homo Spiritus.\r\n\r\nAfter screening Fierce Light we will then show Zeitgeist – the underground classic the banks don’t want you to see. Unfortunately it’s not your imagination or the drugs, the shadow government and banking system are really out to own you and the world.\r\n\r\nFor those who can’t sleep after watching Zeitgeist, we will screen the cult classic Koyaanisqatsi: Life out of Balance (1982). This movie contains neither dialogue nor narration and is essentially a moving visual auditory poem that juxtaposes dramatic image",

Are you walking around with the curtains to these windows closed to the world?\r\n\r\nIn this eye-opening 90-minute workshop, you will learn the history and evolution of eye contact, and then you will receive practical instruction on how to improve the quality of your eye contact, with friends, loved ones, lovers, and even strangers, for fostering intimacy, connectedness, and trust.\r\n\r\nFor the second half of the workshop, you will have the opportunity to experience for yourself the interconnectedness, trance, ego dissolution and divine rapture that can come from deep, prolonged gazing into another's eyes, as a meditative, tantric practice. Sages, yoginis, dakinis, mystics and poets throughout the ages--including Rumi--have seen eye gazing as one of the most powerful and subtly erotic experiences two humans can share. Come experience this power for yourself.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE FACILITATOR:\r\n\r\nMichael Ellsberg is the founder of Eye Gazing Parties (www.eyegazingparties.com), the world's first singles events based on eye contact. These were featured in the New York Times, CNN, Good Morning America, and major media around the globe.\r\n\r\nHe is the author of The Power of Eye Contact, coming out from HarperCollins in February 2010.",

    "description": "John Brennan founder of Free Photography Zone has been photographing the participants of BM in a studio setting for 13 years.  Each person photographed is given a Polaroid print of themselves to remember his/her moment at Burning Man. Over the years I have photographed and watched families grow, welcomed new and old burners and always tried to give each person the best possible portrait of themselves. This is all done in a studio setting with proper strobe lighting and larger format film cameras. Over the years I have made over 30,000 2 1/4 x 2 3/4\" negatives (never really counted) which probably makes this one of the largest archives of  portraits available of Burning Man.  I photograph each day and night for the entire event.   I hope you will take the time to visit my camp and be photographed.",

Feel free to come to the muthaship dressed in your best desert glam gear and freak out like the spiders from mars. We may just start a glam army. The muthaship thursday night will host BOOTIE. Need I say more? And our proudest achievement is that we've managed to get the acid cabaret back in full form. Look for it thursday from way late to wicked early. Come in and perform WHATEVER YOU WANT. Host partyball will spit retarded genius all over you. Don't miss it. Funkcamp will be in fandango. Fandango will be drunk.",

Come all with your music - guitars, sitars, hangs, drums, trumpets and trombones - and jam out together and sing to the amazingly amplified heartbeats of your friends!\r\n\r\nBring music back to its roots, the human heartbeat.  Have your own pulse amplified out over bass heavy speakers as your friends find the rhythm, improvise incredible tunes, and create beautiful music to the most instinctual of sounds.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~\r\n\r\nImagine...\r\nAs you walk with friends at night through the cool desert air you happen upon a huge red-lit platform and walk to its center.  You decide to sit down in the 3 comfortable arm chairs and contemplate a sculpture of the human heart. As you place your hands on the arm rests, the sound of your heartbeat suddenly throbs out of massive bass heavy speakers, echoing into the sky and deep within your core.  A warm light pulses against your face, strobing your eyes with mesmerizing intensity.  A subsonic transducer vibrates your body to the rhythm of your pulse.  All this in complete synchronicity with your heartbeat and in orchestra with the beats of your friends as you relax into sensory overload and trance-like meditation.  Others lay on the vibration platform near the chairs to take in the symphony of human biorhythms as you connect with your own heart and with those around you.\r\n...Welcome to the heartbeat amplifier project.  \r\n\r\n~~~~~~",

All levels welcome, no experience required. \r\n\r\nKundalini uses sets of physical exercises (kriyas) and/or breathing techniques (pranayam) in harmony with other tools such as mantra (sound current), mudra (hand positions), drishtis (eye focal points) and bhands (body locks) to intensify the effects of the kriya.\r\n\r\nThese very simple but highly effective techniques and exercises are done alone or in combination. Developed over the millennia, these empowering techniques produce immediate results. They quickly and effectively clean the blood and body of toxins. They build strength and endurance on many levels. They clear the mind of unwanted and unhealthy thought patterns. And, they create new opportunities for growth and prosperity in life.",

    "description": "The Karen are a diverse people in the nation of Burma, now Myanmar. The Karen were originally animists, and today most are Buddhists or Christians. Some of their 1,700 year old tradition remains to this date, although often cloaked in Buddhism or Christianity.\r\nThe Karen healers once traveled village to village, dispensing free health care, psychiatric care, marriage counseling, communications with those who passed, and so on. Their services were free, and they were held in high esteem.\r\n\r\nSome of their knowledge survived to this day. A practitioner of this modicum isn't allowed to charge for healing, so naturally there is very little knowledge or interest in this ancient tradition. We'll be concentrating on the massage side of the modicum, which in addition to bringing relief was also believed to promote good health and longevity.\r\nWe'll be reviewing some very basic massage and energy work techniques, the Burmese ideas of body/energy connections, and the art of Regarding.\r\n\r\nlesson plan:\r\n- Intro to Karen Burmese philosophy and beliefs.\r\n- Very brief explaining the Grid system, similar to the Chinese meridian system.\r\n- Massage techniques\r\n<br>\r\nfacilitator experience:<br>\r\n\r\nWorkshop led by Ron Hod, one of only 3 non-Karen practitioners of Karen Burmese healing techniques, who has been practicing for 14 years. The church leaders who once offered the training no longer do so, so further training can only be achieved in Thailand or Myanmar (Burma). Ron is initiated, attuned, and aligned in the Karen Burmese art of Opendove Form (/Open Dove Form) modicum, a system of energy and body work that dates back over 1,700 years. \r\n\r\nThe workshop is open to anyone interested in massage, not just body or energy workers.\r\n\r\nhttp://karen.org/\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people\r\n\r\nhttp://www.geocities.com/rainbowendsfr/karen/history.htm",

    "description": "In 2008, the year Burning Man's Theme was the \"American Dream,\" Polaroid announced their stop of large format production - the last chapter of the American made medium. Owen A Kelly thought how he might combine Polaroid with the theme of B.M. Consequently, he produced portraits identifying with the social tapestry of BRC on Type-55 Polaroid. The 4x5 in. portraits display BRC's dynamic reflection and positivity towards creative representation (My American Dream). Each participant receives the original Polaroid within moments. Owen later processes the negative in the field, combining the sensitive medium with Playa properties. With the last finite stock of Type-55 and 59, he is honoring the Mutant Vehicles with the \"Evolution\" of his BRC Playa Portraits Project. Expanding the studio he built in 2008, he is 'Evolving' on the 'American Dream' theme to accommodate Rolling Art. In short, Owen is participating with Burning Man Evolution by building a gigantic Polaroid Booth intended for Mutant Vehicles of both daytime and nighttime breeds, all sizes, grandeurs and riding participants. The original Polaroid goes to the operator during the portrait session, digital scans will be available to participants after the event. By Fine Art documenting this post-modern utilitarian art, He wishes to share the marvels of the 2009 Mutants with those unable to witness it themselves.",

I am also a piano player and am looking for pianos to perform on. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, I came to the playa with my upright piano on a rolling platform and played all over the place. Unfortunately I had to be airlifted out of Burning Man due to a health emergency and had to leave my piano behind. I understand it was here last year, even though I wasn't, and that it was  possibly gifted to the DPW, who may have burned it or may have stored it and are bringing it back. It is a black upright with a sliding window on the front. If it shows up somewhere this year, I would love to come tune and repair it for whomever has taken care of it and play my heart out for you.\r\n\r\nContact me at Playa Magic, located at 3:00 and Adept. I will be there all week, and have piano tuning gear with me to bring to your camp.\r\n\r\nIf before the event,contact me at 713-855-9077",

    "description": "Hello beautiful sister,You are lovingly invited to be a part of a workshop called \"Sacred Touch massage For Women\", a gathering that honors the healing and pleasure of our divine feminine bodies.Why this is being offered? We are living in an era in which we feel shame around sharing the truth about what is happening in our bodies. So many amazing women haven't felt safe around attending playa events for fear around having to reveal their own personal std/sti status with others, or have shied away from relationships for this same reason. Therefore, a safe sacred space will be created in order to share this deep form of priestess education and knowledge passed down from moon rites of long ago, here at the amazing Evolutionary Temple 2009.The gathering will begin with a grounding and intention sharing, followed by a guided experience through various forms of goddess bodywork, such as pelvic healing, yoni massage, g-spot, sacred spot, and cervical massage, emotional clearing through our genitals, orgasm potential, and possibilities around creating an erotic experience at a play event if the group energy feels right for it.Everyone will have a chance to be the giver as well as the receiver. This is a very safe space for women to learn how to give and receive ancient sacred healing sessions with each other, and, with the focus being on female sexuality, to practice communication and freely express desires and boundaries. Our massage gathering is a ancient healing rite intended to deepen the soul centered experience of empowerment and healing our relationship with our bodies, our hearts, our sex, and our spirit. Whether we process or pleasure, everything that transforms in us is always perfect.Please bring a towel/blanket to lie on, any lotions, oils, or sacred objects, as many questions you wish to ask, and your beautiful organic self.",

This event will be nuts!  Two hours of fun and light hearted humor.  We organized this ball as both a celebration and a condemnation of the elusive playa-beast known as the \"shirt-cocker\".  Whether you stand tall or just hang out with us, you may win one of many prizes awarded in different categories (Best Shirt, Best Cock, Funniest Overall Appearance, etc).  So join us!  Represent!  Show your pride!  Show us you've got balls!  There will be a myriad of lovely ladies in attendance as admirers (and mockers) of shirt-cockers.  This event was a raging success last year, so now we host one every year and collectively, they are know as \"the shirt-cocker's balls\"! There will be music and dancing. Limited beer, wine and cocktail wieners will be served (feel free to BYOB). And be sure to wear sunglasses (and maybe a nice ribbon for the little guy) for plausible deniability as there will be a group photo taken for the Burningman archives. Be a part of Burningman history or you're just another dick!",

Come join us as we talk about the pros and cons of having a Little Jimmy (and yes, there are pro's!), look at photos of pint-sized celebrities, share techniques (gay \r\n& straight) for maximizing what you got, possibly drink some vodka, do a bit of \"I'll show you mine if you show me yours,\" and, if we're feeling daring (or drunk), we'll make some posters and parade as a contingent in the Critical Dicks March, which starts at 12pm.  And as an extra incentive, the smallest cock (of those who choose to compete) wins a free bottle of vodka! \r\n(Everyone with a penis is invited, but if you're bigger than, say, 6\" hard, we might ask you to leave.  And yes, participants WILL be asked to get naked!  If this terrifies you, this workshop is for you!)",

I encourage you to come for a good long while and watch and see what you see.  it's one of the coolest things on the playa, and I tend to enjoy it alone.  After 10 years, it's time to share the secret.  Come on out :)  7:11 and I is where we'll gather and we'll walk out to beyond the outer ring and share some magical time together.

For the first year, they traveled the country full time in a 16’ teardrop trailer, and now base their adventures out of their upgraded 17’ fiberglass trailer ideally suited for their technomadic lifestyle.\r\n\r\nTheir trailer is outfitted with solar panels for power and they utilize cellular data networks for their wireless broadband. This keeps their Internet-hungry laptops connected as they conduct their lives and businesses primarily online.\r\n\r\nThey travel across the country, blogging the entire way (www.technomadia.com), to attend interesting events, meet amazing people, and see incredible things. They prove that life, adventure, and rewarding work can be seamlessly merged together into an inspiring life. And they really are a living laboratory for mobile technology.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, they’ll discuss the decision-making process to take inspiration to technomadism, selecting the right arsenal of technology, constructing your ideal mobile home, and legal issues such as domicile, voting, registration, and taxes.",

The presentation incorporates elemental imagery that Sunny painted from a series of “Big Dreams”. These images are based in alchemy and a visual, elemental and spatial narrative. Each of us creates a “life story” in which we give meaning to our lives. The intention of the imagery and exercises in this presentation are to facilitate a beginning of reclamation- to give meaning and importance to our life stories.We will examine how during our lives, we have traveled through four alchemical regions represented by the elements, water (Solutio), Fire (Calcinatio), Air (Sublimatio) and Earth (Coagulatio). We will view these stories through the lens of Jungian, archetypal, and depth psychology. We will explore concepts in mythology, alchemy, archetypal imagery, and depth psychology and how they relate to the symbols in both our waking and dreaming lives. If time allows, we will process experiential exercises which follow the path through the four elements. Using the images from the workbook, we have an evocative starting place. The written and practical exercises are intended to help facilitate the audience’s reclamation and integration of these archetypal realms.",

The drug war is one of those topics that is always met with fierce resistance for a number of reasons involving class and race and cultural identity. But more than that, it is one of those archetypal issues that is in conflict with the American mythology that we are governed by the rule of law, and the morality of righteousness. One of the great new stories we need to tell is the true history of US involvement in the global drug trade and the integral role of drugs in the American economic and political systems,  how the American government has created many of the drug problems it claims the War on Drugs is supposedly designed to address. Learn about the domestic prison crisis, and what all those drug laws are really all about. In a reprise of his M.A.P.S/Entheon Village DreamRise presentation from the 2008 Burning Man festival,  \"The Secret History of the War on Drugs\" is taken from his work-in-progress, Exile Nation, a book that chronicles his experiences in the drug war as both a recovering addict and activist working to raise awareness and reform drug policy, and the time he spent in prison on a non-violent drug possession charge.\"",

You’ll discover the possibility of reconnection with your innate beauty, wholeness and be honest with yourself and and with others in a safe circle of love. You can discover those places you’ve felt stuck, while you are supported in letting go. You learn to become aware of those times when you get in your own way, and come to see the choices open to you. You embrace what you desire the most, and deeply commit to letting your dreams and your visions be more important than you past wounds. You will find yourself reconnecting with your innate beauty, wholeness and power in each moment.\r\n\r\nHeart of Now workshops include numerous assistants to support you and to create a sacred space for transformation. A deeply nurturing environment is created. This teamwork approach deepens the experience of service and camaraderie, where all are able to experience their vulnerabilities, allowing trust and growth.

Crystals are positioned to the four directions, below the meditation cushion inside the pyramid, and above the head where the ends of the tree trunks come together. The geometry of the pyramid and the placement of the crystals amplify the natural flow of your energy and the power of your intentions as you sit inside the space. Singing bowls, wind chimes, sage and juniper bring sound and smell into the experience.These sacred juniper trees died in a natural forest fire in Skull Valley, Utah years ago. Their rebirth as an art installation is a reminder of our own rebirth and transformation as we progress through life.",

Haramein's theory demonstrates as well a parallel between ancient codes in documents and monuments. This all-encompassing theory may prove to be one of the most important discoveries of our time.",
