Bribery and \r\nfoolishness are considered de rigueur.\r\n\r\nAll that is necessary is that you have some form of facial hair, a \r\ngood and jolly spirit, and the necessary accoutrement of a cummerbund. \r\nOne must have the proper air of formality around such an event as this, \r\ndo not you agree?",

It is very hot, but it isn’t sex; there is no sexual interaction between the giver and receiver except for the massage, and boundaries will be respected.  The workshop focuses on the male body, though women can give massage. Come early; latecomers and spectators will not be admitted, and we've had to turn people away every year.",

We welcome everyone that can sing or at least use your voice! and if you are mute or sworn to silence, we can find something for you to contribute too, if you want to be a part of our choir! (maybe you sign?) Singers of all abilities are welcome! We love readers, but if you don't read, it's OK. If you sing in the shower, we love you! If you sing to the radio, we want you! If you have choral experience, we need you! If you play a rhythm section instrument, please contact Madi right away! We give a Sunday service where we sing for a healthy and dusty audience at 11 am, so if you can't commit to the sunday service, well, you can still be a part of the choir! (but we'd rather you stuck around for the performance..!) This year, we will rehearse in Jazz Cafe, as we have in the past. But our sunday service will be in the center circle of center camp! This way, we should have enough room for the audience this time! come join us for some wonderful singing, fun and fierce rehearsals and a chance to meet some really awesome folks who you might not have met otherwise!",

Well, this year we've completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and we've given it a new name: The Orgasmator.  You will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, and deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience that is safe and leaves you feeling completely respected and in-control.  Come solo, or better yet, bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and personal experience.  You can wear as much or as little as you would like while riding this marvelous machine, and you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense.  If you are a woman, the Orgasamator Experience at Spanky's I-Scream Parlour is something you won't want to miss.",

A sweet remix of the wedding march will play behind the treehugger/puking unicorn bus courtesy of DJ Whatever. Join us for a Champagne toast to the Bride, words of inspiration from the Reverend Thomasutra and a night of rock n' roll in bride regalia.\r\n\r\nCome march cause you believe in love or cause you want to believe in love! Come march cause you already have a dress or you would love to have a dress! Come march cause this is your big break to bride up without all the family drama! Come march cause it was so much fun (or not) when you did it the first time. Come and MARCH cause you might never do it or do it again. Come for Joselynn. Come for yourself. Come for fun. Come to be serious. Come to be silly. JUST COME.\r\n\r\nWho: YOU!\r\nWhat: 100 Brides march for the Bacharette Party of Joselynn Plank\r\nWhere: Wed night - Burningman 2010 - Return of Arson Island Resort (RAIR) 4:30 & B\r\nWhen: When the sun hits the mountain\r\nHow: Get yourself a wedding dress (in any state of repair or disarray) and show up to join the fun\r\n\r\nNow get out there and start looking for your dress.

Enjoy fine shaved Snow with Sour electrolytes or Sweet Syrups in flavors of our choice as we deny you your desires in life and give you what we know you need, sorta like in real life but a bit worse.    Success of your quest is Highly dependent on the Ice supply which, once shaved, flavored and ingested can Melt quickly in the heat of the day. Ask about solutions to a shortage if this happens and you still have a severe need of Cool.    If the Ice has melted with no solutions available, you can still stop by and cool off for a minute in our self venting dust reducing open front shade Contraption and watch the city roll by as you cool down again to prepare for your next trek down the chosen path.  Please let any BRC Rangers or Emergency response volunteers to cut into line for a quick cooling if they stop by.  The Contraptionists also Host Naked Misted Twister at the same time of day which is for Adults only and screened with no spectators allowed.

    "description": "Find SoulTouch at Sacred Spaces and Entheon Village this year. Will detail the schedule when we know it.Come experience the healing work of the Hardest working & possibly the most Hilarious healer on the playa.  More than healings, but activations, ALLNESS blessings, empowerments, attunements. A true Guru's Grace in his touch.\r\nDon't take his word for it. Here are just two of many thousands of similar testimonials:\r\n\r\nMegan Read June 6 at 12:47am \r\n..My friend is in a coma she had a major heart attack and major stroke she has no brain function and her kidneys have failed and her body slowly shutting down and she has a 5 year old son no one knows what has caused this she has been in a coma 2 weeks now \r\n\r\nMegan Read June 13 at 2:58am \r\nHey thanks for ur healing prayers for my friend.  A miracle happened this week. She woke up from her coma. The doctors said her organs had all shut down. She was brain dead and there was no hope of her waking up. But she woke up with no memory loss and the doctors can’t find much wrong with her.  She is up eating, talking, walking, doing everything natural. It’s a miracle! Doctors are amazed & so are every one of her friends and family \r\n\r\nHi Whimsical,\r\n... I'm the psychiatrist who treats actresses and writers (ha). I saw you two times .....You left an indelible impression on me. I can recall the state I found myself in while you were working on me. It allows me to return to that\r\nplace of consciousness where everything is allowed, nothing is resisted and the\r\ndeep longing I feel meets desire in every other molecule around me. Under your\r\ntouch there was hardly a you and a me.\r\nThere was just an experience of the fundamental vibration of love.",

Art may also be committed to the Home, just put it securely in place and say good-bye.

    "description": "Come to Great Balls of Fire to receive the best care available on the Playa for women with two feet (or even one!). The alkaline quality of the Playa surface can dehydrate and damage our skin, and our feet get a big dose of it if you’re wearing sandals, flip-flops, or *going barefoot*. Our feet are a part of our bodies that are often receive far less attention than they deserve given how vital good foot health is for our mobility and overall well-being. So reconnect with your feet and revitalize them by pampering them with a Barefoot Bliss treatment that includes a lemon juice bathing to neutralize alkalinity, followed by a luxuriant reflexology foot massage using rehydrating lotion. The treatment requires being barefoot, (of course!) and utter bliss is the guaranteed result, hence the name. Your feet will thank you!\r\n \r\nThe gift of Barefoot Bliss is available throughout each day beginning Tuesday morning. Look for the Barefoot Bliss signs at the Great Balls of Fire camp and ask for Pringles. It’s offered primarily for women of the Playa, but Pringles will have a female assistant who will be available at select times for interested boyfriends and overflow women.",

Prints will be mailed a few weeks after the event, as I work in traditional emulsion based process. Everyone is welcome, including families with children.\r\n\r\nThe human form is art’s oldest and most persistent subject. Photography, perhaps the most documentarian of all art forms, is a particularly challenging medium for it. My approach is not to challenge photography’s inherent literalism but work within its framework.  My subjects are real people, who happen to be nude and whose nudity is neither contrived nor interactive. They don’t call for an action or elicit a particular response from the viewer.\r\n\r\nI also hope that my images aren’t nudesploitation either:  the human form I strive for isn’t employed to talk about anything else whatsoever. Hence, I don’t work with professional models or in a studio. If you are interested in posing for this project, please come by.  \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in assisting, and are well versed in practice and theory of photography as an art medium, please get in touch.",

If a trapeze and a hula hoop had a baby, the lyra is it.  It's round, metal and wrapped.  It can spin! If you have always wanted to fly, and never tried...  If you have a desire to take hooping to a higher level... If you like curves, bored with tire swings, and your spinning class goes nowhere, this class is for you.  Do you want to have fun spinning in the air making pretty poses?  I'll teach you how to look and feel fabulous!  Please wear tight clothing that won't fall in your face when you are upside down! Or wear your spandex long-underwear.  I will try to have some skin tight t-shirts.  The more your legs are covered the better you will learn from me.  See you on top, Mandy Pants.",

The goal is to teach kids what it takes to sustain life at Burning Man, how embrace their creativity, teach playa-survival skills and teach them how to get involved in their BRC community, not just skip through it. The ultimate goal is to inspire kids to volunteer as they grow up, take ownership of their community and become model burners. \r\n\r\nCamps, services and the Black Rock community will host playa-cational events and offer volunteer opportunities for kids. Scouts will earn patches, tokens or pins for things learned, survival skills achieved, volunteering, good deeds and connections made, to be worn on functional bandoleer sashes. Funds are being raised for patches, but hosts are welcome to provide patches, tokens, pendants or pins.\r\n\r\nThe hope is that the Black Rock community will accept and value Burner-kids as a vital part of their community, after all... they are the future of Burning Man.\r\n\r\nJoin us on Facebook and Yahoo Groups. Event schedule will be posted on Yahoo Groups, at Playa Info and Kidsville Center Camp. Volunteers and funds for patches are needed, so contact us if you'd like to help.",

They will bring citizens of BRC Metropolis to their fantastic planet introducing them to some of the surreal and grotesque entities that belong in realms of darkness. Since 1988 “blackSKYwhite” has been shocking audiences in many famous international shows as Edinburgh Theatrical Festival, London International Mime Festival, Glastonbury Festival and dozens more. Finally this world famous and repeated awarded troupe comes to Burning man in 2010! \r\nTheir shows illuminate the term 'total theatre': the costumes, scenery, lighting, music and movement blend so seamlessly into a language we all recognize in our deepest emotions and dreams. In this bizarre world there are aliens and creepy crawlies that are fascinating as they twitch and squirm. \r\nThey are the products of a riotous imagination and we are as enthralled as we are repelled. There is beauty and fear, malice and mischief, magnificent creations jerking and wobbling and shuffling and slithering and bouncing around the stage. It is a dance macabre of feverish rhythms.",

The race will take place on Wednesday, September 1st, starting at 5 a.m. (with mandatory race meeting at 4:45 a.m.).\r\n\r\nParticipants can attire themselves however they would like (the more entertaining, the better), but should wear running sneakers (or Vibrams, if that's how you roll), and MUST carry at least one bottle of water. There will be 2-3 aid stations with water and running snacks (and we welcome volunteers to help dispensing the water and assist the runners with cheers, hydration, snacks, and sweaty hugs -- please contact me if you'd like to volunteer!), and runners can leave drop bags at the main aid station.

    "event_id": 3658,
    "description": "Born in Chicago in the 80's, and a far cry from the civilized quiet Tuesday afternoon readings in back corners of libraries that you may have in mind when someone says \"poetry\", a poetry slam is a rowdy competition where the emphasis is on performance, entertainment and audience participation. Five judges will be placed in the audience and will give you a score out of 10 based on audience reaction. Poets job is to win over the audience.\r\n\r\nA poem can be whatever you want it to be – a story, a rant, a social commentary, a personal confession. It can be funny, sexy, bizarre, political, truth or complete BS, whatever – provided that you follow a few simple rules, explained below.\r\n\r\n-\tPoems must be original material by the person who is performing\r\n-\tPoets get 3 minutes at the microphone. Points deducted for going over time\r\n-\tThere will be two rounds. 12 poets in first round, 5 in second\r\n-\tNo instruments or props allowed. Costumes should be kept to a minimal\r\n-\tPoems that attack others on basis of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation or any other form of discrimination will not be tolerated and you will be disqualified\r\n\r\nThe event will begin at 5pm on Friday evening at Couch Burners Camp – 5.00 and Florence. This will be a fun event and the audience is encouraged to participate. Feel free to bring shakers, clappers, bells, whistles and other noise makers.\r\n\r\nSo now I am just in need of poets to compete! Step up, bring your mad poetry skills and an attitude and see you if you can walk away with the title of Black Rock City Burning Slam Grand Champion (and hopefully some prizes that I’m trying to source). Send me an email if you’re interested in competing. ajsiggie@gmail.com  I’m also in need of judges, so let me know if you would like to involved that way. \r\n\r\nSee you on the Playa, where words become legends.\r\n\r\nPeace\r\nPrairieKiwi",

There will be two waves of a procession leaving about 6pm going out to the Temple where the ceremony will be. The men will leave first and the women a few minutes later. (So as not to reveal the bride to the groom too soon).\r\n\r\nThe ceremony will take place at the Temple hopefully around 6:30pm.\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to do anything special during the ceremony please let us know.\r\n\r\nAfterward we will be heading to an as yet determined camp (maybe Kostume Kult?) for the afterparty. We'd love to have everyone there to share our joy and some surprises and hopefully bring out all of your best performance skills and talents to help create a magical evening!\r\n\r\nTHE BACHELOR/BACHELORETTE PARTY:\r\n\r\nWill be Tuesday night, August 31st. We'll probably start at Rooftop Camp for drinks then head out and find some sexy places to party, but nothing is certain yet. We just hope all of you will come out for some delicious debauchery and fun and get us into lots of trouble before we tie the knot. More details when we get them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER EVENTS:\r\n\r\nWe will be doing some last minute crafting and preparations during the week before the ceremony, especially Wednesday at Rooftop Camp, so feel free to check in with us if you'd like to lend a hand and some artistic skills.\r\n\r\n**ALSO**!!!!!\r\n\r\n*Is anyone not planning on arriving at Burning Man until Tuesday or Wednesday or even Thursday? If so, we have a very special, very important mission for you if you'd like to accept it! Please let us know!\r\n\r\nMany many X's and O's,\r\n-Carolina & Matthew",

MOLD MAKING WORKSHOPS\r\nThe first aspect of using the Dragon Smelter is creating the sand molds to cast art.  2 workshops will occur on playa at the DS (see ARTeries Location map) in the late afternoon @ 5:30 p.m. Tues, 08/30  and  Thurs, 09/02.  It last 2 hours, involves using steel frames, art “story” boards, sand & binder in a mini-cement mixer and pressure setting sand to create negative mold images & forms to cast into.   \r\n\r\n2.) Large Casting Events:\r\n5  p.m. to 7 p.m,  Wed. 09-01 & Fri. 09-03 @ Dragon Smelter \r\nThe large casting events involve DS team members plus you, volunteers from BRC “walk-ups”.  We will fire the smelter kiln to 1900 degrees, deposit recycled aluminum cans in the crucible, then pour the melted contents into the sand molds to create relief sculptures. \r\n\r\n3.) METROPOLIS COINAGE \r\nThe small coin smelter is a minature DS. small furnace, crucible and cast iron coin dye which is light and totally mobile.  We will be operating this during the big casting events at the DS & also daily @ different locations around Burning Man. Check with ARTERies for our daily location if you wish to participate, make yourself a coin on other than big casting event days.  This coin is a gifting to reward recycling by all citizens of BRC & also to celebrate the work of Recycle Camp in taking our aluminum cans every year, turning them into funding for Paiute Tribe youth education. For those who participate in this effort, bring their aluminum cans to Recycle Camps we want to convert one or two of them into a “Metropolis Coin” as a gift to reward your effort. 2 to 3 members of our Dragon Smelter team will operate this little machine daily making coins with or for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. P.M. PLAYING WITH FIRE\r\n\r\nDragon Smelter spits flames from it’s mouth and tail. You can participate in running these effects at night with us.  Come to the DS when you see them start up.  Our team will show you how to safety set these shooting flame affects off.\r\n</html>",

(OK, Marie Curie was a notable exception, but she was HOT. Talk about a nuclear family!) So ya see, what comes around, goes around. \r\n\r\nThe Critical Dicks March welcomes all genders: Male, Female, Transsexual, Intersexual, Pansexual, Gay, Bi, Straight, and Bent. However, if you are not naturally blessed with a dick, please bring a long a reasonable fucksimile. \r\nCRITICAL DICKS is a MARCH, not a bike ride, but if you must bring your bike, we have people who will properly guard your bike until you return for it.\r\nThe March starts at noon on Thursday, directly in front of the Man.\r\n\r\nAnd now, let the testosterone flow! Stand proud and erect as you march through the streets of Black Rock City! Cast of the cruel duds of oppression! You have nothing to lose but your shame!",

Acquired over the past year from generous costume companies and burners around the world intent to recycle past glory, we have over 1 ton of costumes to give away, all free (no barter or returns required) but note that you MUST wear what you take and walk the runway to be reborn onto the playa with a new look and attitude.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, in line with BM's decommodification, gifting and immediacy principles, Kostume Kult's costume giveaway dome is not about giving products but empowering experiences.  It is true that the sight of a dome full of free costumes makes eyes dilate, pulses quicken and drooling has been known to occur, but we request that you fight the consumerist urge to \"acquire\"-- to grab armfuls of stuff, to scurry away with thoughts of future times to wear or how there are others you want to supply.  Instead we suggest that you stay in the moment, put something on that makes you feel special and that if you find something absolutely perfect and you see someone else admiring it, please consider taking it off and giving it to them. Playfulness, kindness and generosity are the coins of our realm and we hope you will share.\r\n\r\nCome by to participate and, if you have stuff to donate, please drop it off on-playa early in the week or, better yet, ship it to our Davis, CA logistics hub by contacting Maria and David at squamazon@gmail.com to get the details.",

This year, once again, the Critical Tits Ride will lead to a Women's Only Ritual on the open playa. The volunteer's role is to create and hold the ritual - by welcoming all on their bikes, marking the edge of the Ritual Ring with your bodies and amplifying its sacred nature with your intention of honor and respect for the Goddess in all women - no small task, eh!! \r\n\r\nThis is an essential job to the success of the ritual and the CT Crew is full of gratitude for your participation in this way. During the Ritual, all who join us to hold space along the edge of the Ritual Ring will be asked to face outward, away from the dance towards the open playa. It is no sign of disrespect to you. This desire comes from the intention to create as safe a haven as possible for every woman present. Dancing in a circle of 'watching' individuals could be extremely daunting to some women. \r\n\r\nOur highest intention is to create safety for the most vulnerable in our midst. We are also inviting you to ask all looky-loos and active photographers to be respectful as well – either practicing camera rule #1 of ‘ASK FIRST’ or better yet inviting them to put down their cameras, turn their backs and join you along the sacred edge. \r\n\r\nGathering at the pre-ritual training gives all an opportunity to learn possible new tools of communication as wells as to build the connections between you that will hold the women of CT with love and integrity. This job calls for BIG hearts and grounded spirits, and we know you are out there! \r\n\r\nWe need volunteers, as well, for set up/clean up, bike parking, and drumming. If you want to get involved, contact us at info2010(at)criticaltits(dot)com.",

    "description": "This all day every day game consists of two or more people getting together and speaking on what, if anything, is distracting us from this present moment. Thoughts of the past and the future, however valid, can sometime detract from our experience of this NOW moment. This clearing process opens the space to speak these thoughts and be heard, so that we are able to let them go and be in full enjoyment of the moment. While also being mindful of what is important to us as well. \r\nThrough a series of three questions we, Camp Gratitude, intend to guide Burners back to enjoying the precious time we have here at Burning Man. \r\nThe first question is usually along the lines of \"What are you present to\" followed by \"While you are present to that how do you feel?\" With the listener recreating what they heard back to the speaker, so there is a clear understanding and reflection for the person being cleared. After that there are two \"Questions of the Day.\" The first QotD is directed towards an aspect of our ego or shadow side, and bringing it into light. By being conscious of these processes, and how we feel while present to them, we can work through them and utilize them.",

    "description": "There is great change upon the wind, a paradigm shift the likes of which humanity has never witnessed before. We can all sense it. We can feel it in our very bones, calling from the depths of our collective psyche as we draw ever closer toward what Terrance McKenna referenced as the “eschaton”, the ultimate transcendence from a cultural worldview of Logos (Creative Word) to Holos (Holistic & Collective Conscious Evolution). As we move into the New Millenium, facing the apparent and inevitable collapse of old paradigm structures, it becomes ever more vital for us, both individually and as a species, to recognize the fundamental importance of our unified state of existence both spiritually and as conscious co-creators within the Gaian/Human collective. Toward that end, tryptamines, both endogenous and exogenous, provide us all with a unique opportunity and ability to recognize and noetically realize that unified state of universal consciousness that intimately connects us all, to each other, to all of nature and to Source itself. Through the entheogenic experience we can effectively open our hearts and minds to literally limitless possibilities for fostering harmony, beauty, peace, sustainability and greater economic and environmental efficiency, that will allow us as a species to not only survive but thrive upon our planet in the establishment of the age old vision of the Universal Brother/sisterhood of all Humankind. How can the noetic revelations that the tryptamine experience serve us in this process? Come and join Hal Lucius Nation from the Temple of Awakening Divinity in this enlightening and engaging forum where we will collectively envision and discuss these possibilities.",

Infinity mirror tunnels, whirling roof vents and a submerging conveyor belt filled with tools for the workers below completes the vision. Three regular-sized sledgehammers are the tools for interaction. When a participant slams one down on their target, a deep, audible \"boom\" shakes the ground, feet, ankles, etc. The more simultaneously the three hammers are struck, the higher the tongues of flame travel up the giant hammer itself. If the three participants get the flames all the way to the top, the hammerhead spins with liquid fire, unfolds, and reflects shafts of light downward like an infernal disco ball as the underground turbines audibly groan up to speed. Strength and accuracy matter not-- it's all in the timing. Ein Hammer is a tribute to workers as one.",

It is very hot, but it isn’t sex; there is no sexual interaction between the giver and receiver except for the massage, and boundaries will be respected.

    "description": "Contradance every night until dancers or musicians quit (starts after sunset or after burns Sat Sun). Live music - didj, electric fiddle; looped/ trad'nal/ celtic/ fusion/ techno. Fast paced but easy to learn.  We will cycle through different levels - you won't have to wait long for beginner level w/ lessons.  (And there will be a neighboring dance area for those who prefer to freestyle.)  A caller instructs but there is room for dancers to improvise. 1/2 the moves w/ your partner, 1/2 w/ everyone else. No need to bring a partner (dancers swap partners after every dance).  Zen is flow, synchrony, bonding (not footwork, not competition).  If you are smiling, you are doing it right. \r\n\r\nBecause couples flow through one another in long lines and end up interacting with everyone, it has a very tribal feel–w/ bonding through synchronous stomping, clapping and hooting.  It is very playful (variations and flourishes improvised ad lib) and flirtatious.  Dancers typically include all ages from children to the elderly, and include people with a surprising range of disabilities.  Dancers and callers frequently swap gender roles, and playfully mock gender conventions.\r\n\r\nThe caller gives instructions for each dance's particular repeating cycle of ~10 moves.  The basic moves are very easy to learn, but lessons are necessary for advanced moves, and so that new dancers don't become disoriented, and can more quickly get to the point of enjoying the flow.  We will use a LCD projector and screen to get dancers up to speed as quickly as possible.  While the caller explains individual moves and line movement verbally, the screen will show them diagrammatically from above, and w/ POV video of real dancers from the side.   \r\n\r\nSlippery shoes are helpful.  A less than full stomach will make it easier for some to avoid dizziness.  Dancers expect to adjust their behavior to suit each person they meet in the line (e.g. just ask for minimal spinning or whatever else makes you comfortable).",

This event is so extreme it can only be contained by Death Guild’s Thunderdome! A parody of the T.V. show “American Idol” Fire Performers will compete for Fire Trophies by surviving their elimination round, only to come face-to-face with our three Fire Idol Judges in round two.  As always, our judges appreciate bribes. \r\n\r\n Round One:  4 men enter. One man leaves.  As always, women are welcome and encouraged to compete. Spin your hearts out to really bad music, while being heckled by our M/C and Fire Idol judges.\r\n\r\n Round Two: One man enters. Alone. Your mission: to survive the intense tongue lashing from our Judges with your dignity, ego and sense of humor intact. Top three winners are gifted mini-thunderdome fire (propane) trophies.\r\n\r\n Bring your gear (and your balls).  We’ll provide the fuel (white gas only). Signups begin 1/2 hour prior to the event at Death Guild’s Thunderdome.\r\n\r\n Warning:  this event is for immature audiences only.  Pansies, cry-babies, the truly untalented, and those with fragile egos need not apply.  On second thought, maybe this is exactly what you need!  Come on down.\r\n\r\n“Congratulations. You're the first to survive the audition…”\r\nAunty – Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome",

Instead of hitting the ball as in traditional tetherball, you are encouraged to grab the ball and throw or swing it. Keep your wits about you, this is real fire. Aggressive play can result in the whole thing tipping over, so go easy. \r\n\r\nWe have optional face shields which are great if you get hit in the face, but they tend to fog up and are generally less than comfortable. If you have a suggestion for improved face protection, we welcome ideas. \r\n\r\n\r\nPeople always ask how you win. Personally, I think if you're playing, you've already won. But if you simply must sort out a winner, a point is scored when you wrap the chain all the way around the pole till it can't go any further. Your opponent tries to stop that by trying to do the same thing in the opposite direction. How many points? Whatever. \r\n\r\nAnd feel free to pass the ball on to a friend before the fire burns out, because it's important that we let the ball cool down over a shot of whiskey in between burns.",

When I think “no one likes me” then I don’t return phone calls, I don’t initiate conversations and thus I bring about the exact thing which I believe. \r\n\r\nUsing group work, guided meditation, and written exercises, this workshop will show you how to make friends with the mind.

Discover God in every day life. Become one with The One and change the way you live. Learn how to talk to God and listen so you can clearly hear God speaking to you.

Jonathan takes us to the place where the soul of hip hop, the catharsis of rock and roll, the trance of techno and the heart of house collide into the world beat. And in this beat, we get together to reinvent ourselves, to discard last week’s fears and move into this week’s dreams. This is our practice. It doesn’t matter where we come from or how we grew up or whether we can or can’t dance. Movement is medicine, and whether we feel clumsy or graceful, it heals us. Real learning happens when we show up and move because the body can’t lie. It lets us know right away if we’re feeling closed or open, fixed or fluid, tight or loose, off or on. We carry so many things, and not just in our backpacks. What do we do with all this repressed stuff, the headtrips that are holding us back, holding us down, and turning us into something we’re not? We dance. We dance with whatever’s going on inside of us and connect with others who are doing the same. Fueled by the ecstatic language of the 5Rhythms, this is movement as spiritual practice, a dancing, kinetic prayer of connection to the unpredictable mystery of it all.",

    "description": "This class will show how massage can be enhanced both for the giver and receiver using the techniques of \"touch relaxation\", \"seeing fingers\" and \"focused intention\". Individuals and couples are welcome (you'll pair up for practice either way). The class will emphasize healing rather than sensual massage, but the techniques are equally applicable to both.\r\n\r\n1) Touch relaxation: often the receiver is ignored in massage classes, and I think that's a shame, because all of the really important work has to be done by them, and the giver is but a guide and assistant. This technique is based on focused intention to relax in response to touch. The technique is practiced in pairs during the class.\r\n\r\n2) Seeing Fingers: I tend to not even bother with my eyes when giving with massages, because all the important things you can perceive you \"see\" through your fingertips. This is a skill that can only be learned through practice, and it ties in strongly with the previous concept.\r\n\r\n3) Focused Intention: I do some practical demonstrations of what happens when your attention (and therefore intention) wanders during massage, then have a discussion and practice regarding how intention shapes all of what you accomplish during a massage. \r\n\r\nIn the past, people who have attended, especially massage therapists, have been very appreciative of the emphasis on connection between the the giver and receiver vs. specific techniques.\r\n\r\nTaught by Dreamweaver in the 4th Chakra Temple at Sacred Spaces.\r\n\r\nI have taught this class with Ascension Tribe several times in the past. I'm self-taught but have been giving and receiving massage for most of my life, and have accumulated my knowledge from a variety of sources, experiential, scientific, and spiritual.",

The original ceremony consists of a variety of manners to drink, but to experience this fully, please drink with a style you favor most. The most interesting practice would be turning your thought toward him for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. \r\n\r\nI always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy. I'll be happy if you find any good idea for the future prospect of our metropolis throughout this performance. A big red umbrella will be there as the landmark. GRATEFUL RED!\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I will exhibit my works and will serve you the tea again in San Francisco after Burning Man. Please join us when you are free.

Sounds captured may include drumbeats, vocals, guitar melodies or other found sounds. The participant stands under an arch containing speakers, immersed in the sound of their loops, from above and below. The user's figure is framed in a circular opening, a reference to the etymology of the words areola (diminutive form of the Greek word for \"open space\"), aureole (the traditional \"halo\" of light around sacred figures in Medieval art) and the literal \"audio relay\" that is being created. The installation resembles a vertical silver ring, with bamboo fiberglass-clad plywood bases and a semi-transparent fabric covered spaceframe arch, illuminated from within. The looping instructions are very simple, and will be clearly posted. The pedal/trigger will be a large button in the center of the installation, and a 1/4\" input, microphone, and electric guitar will be provided. \r\n\r\nThe user interface will be very straightforward and minimal. A participant walking by the sculpture with a djembe could -within minutes- be creating her own drum circle, with literally dozens of versions of herself playing in unison. Amateur singers will be able to experience harmonizing to themselves. Guitar players will be able to lay down the chords to their songs and then write BRC-inspired solo melodies.",

Nightly, Malvoye's powers of mentalism are summoned to give YOU your very own unique and astonishingly accurate fortune. \r\n\r\nMalvoye knows all, Malvoye sees all. \r\n\r\nSeeking love, wealth or the answer to that burning question deep inside you? Each and every reading gives YOU the chance to ask Malvoye your most burning questions. So, come one, come all—put Malvoye to the test! Malvoye's beautiful assistants will instruct you on the proper use of the machine. BUT DO BEWARE, as true fortunes convey more than mere pacifying happiness and positivity. \r\n\r\nNow heard in fully restored Vita-phonic sound! \r\n\r\nA truly unique experience for the citizens of the playa, this Deco 1930's booth was only just recently restored after nearly being lost to time and the elements. The booth, reportedly once part of a now long defunct traveling sideshow, was famous for its uncanny accuracy and genuine powers. In its day, it was said to be the creation of Edgar Cayce (the \"Sleeping Prophet\") who was somehow able to imbue his power into the booth. It is also said to be the true inspiration for the Tom Hanks's film Big. It is believed to be one of only five Malvoye booths made and the only one known to have survived. It has been painstakingly rewired and restored by a group of burners in the Philadelphia area who happened upon the booth at a local auction and flea market.\r\n\r\n***The booth will only be powered and functioning during the times listed though other random nightly hours will be added, especially around the nights of the burns. PLEASE DO NOT attempt to use the booth during other times as you could easily damage it, respect the set boundaries and do not touch the booth.",

This workshop will have a lecture/discussion component which details how old religious and discipleship methods are fading and new collaborative and individual paths of awakening are evolving. We will discuss ways that each person can help, and be helped, within our community, to contribute to the positive transformation of each other and the planet. Some interactive finish involving meditation, eye-gazing, small groups or what the moment calls will conclude the workshop. Festival culture will be prominently discussed as a pilgrimage, a community celebration and prayer, and a vortex for energy to uplift the planet. - by Karl Baba",

Many residents and BRC Rangers seek us out to renew friendships and get a new medallion every year. This year, we will have a very special medallion. All we ask in return is to show yer bum and get spanked!\r\n\r\nAll of our activities will take place under a large, inviting, and stimulating\r\nshade structure (night AND day) in front of LAFer Camp with plenty of chairs for residents to get off their feet or bike and chill or play with our paints and other toys—all week long.

PHONOFLaKES from Switzerland, Europe followed this route.\r\n\r\nThe band presents emotional, yet wrenching work, which needs no explanation. With an uncompromising and spontaneous Alternative Rock / Power Pop, their music is a strong and honest impact that gets to you. And it is this strength, expressed through their simple but direct naturalness, which has always been a defining quality of the bands live shows.\r\n\r\nPHONOFLaKES displays a personality equaled by no other band. Singer Melanie Schweickardt’s exceptional voice puts the band among the greatest Swiss bands – despite the fact they just started working on their debut long player in April 2010.\r\n\r\n«We made it!» isn’t in the vocabulary of this tireless group. The main goal of PHONOFLaKES is to move ever forward. There’s no doubt what so ever – these guys know what to do and how to do it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, the band played several shows in San Francisco’s Bay Area, a live radio showcase on KPDO 89.3 pirate cat radio and also performed on the center camp stage at Burning Man 2009.\r\n\r\nPHONOFLaKES promised to come back to California and Burning Man 2010 and they will give you a night to remember!",

Any potential name is always discussed and ultimately agreed upon by a quorum of three people before being chosen. Once chosen, a short baptismal ceremony is performed by our very own Master of Ceremonies, a personalized badge is hand-drawn by our resident artists and offered to the person, who then sign or draw their newly-acquired Playa Name in our Book of Names. \r\n\r\nAs with last year, passers-by may also choose to have a Tarot Reading from our resident Witch Doctor while waiting. New this year, we will be offering delicious iced tea to quench your playa thirst. Activities will all take place inside our new dome, where you can relax and enjoy.",

Sing, drum, and dance a body prayer home to yourself, your sisters and your wild heart.  \r\n\r\nThis year, once again, the Critical Tits Ride will lead to a Women's Only Ritual on the open playa.  \r\n\r\nBike Parking Gods will usher all female, or identifying as female, riders into the bike parking area. From there, enter the Ritual on foot, passing through the Serenading Portals of the Acaplaya Choir, into the Ritual Ring. All are invited to join their voices with the choir and welcome their sisters into the Ritual Ring.\r\n\r\nThe circumference of the Ring is held by the bodies of our Sacred Space Holders - facing outward towards the open playa to engage looky loos asking them to respect the event and lower the cameras.  Along the circumference, at each of the cardinal points - East/Child, South/Maiden, West/Warrior Mother, North/Crone - are our Drummers, grounding our spirits while enticing our bodies to fly.  Our Nipple Card Goddesses will again offer CT Nipple cards as well as ribbons on which to write prayers to be tied to the circumference of the Ritual Ring. The ribbons will later be taken to the temple to burn.\r\n\r\nAs the ritual reaches a critical mass of tits, one of our High Priestesses will begin the dancing body prayer - connecting us to our own wild hearts, those of our sisters' and out to that of the playa itself.\r\n\r\nNot for spectators. We invite partners and friends to help hold the ritual space. We need volunteers for set up/clean up, bike parking, drumming and holding of the ritual space.

For 2010 we're bringing back our classic hot pepper drinks and adding a few more exclusive pours to the Incendiary Intent bar. We kick off the burn on Monday night with an open bar and fire performance, taking in that enthusiasm the first day brings. Lighting up and pouring drinks on Wednesday and Friday, we're sure to get some returning friends and a whole new crowd ready to taste our wicked brews.

Give and receive healings for happiness, well being and the removal of emotional blockages. The healing will be centred at the Base or Root and Heart Chakra for sexual healing. Hands on healing all boundaries are respected. Singles and partners welcome. \r\n\r\nEvery relationship we ever experience with our parents, friends, kids, lovers, co-worker, boss etc, has an effect on who we are our personalities and our sexuality. Many times this works like a wall that we put up that keeps us from our true desires and keeps us from happiness and it can also work like a chastity belt of; rejection, anger, fear and other emotions. When the class is over participants will feel one of these emotional weights have been lifted. They will feel lighter. Their Heart Chakra’s will be open and Root Chakra will be lighter and feel protected. it is possible relationships of every kind will be more nurturing and healthy.",

    "description": "aka Women's Shakti empowerment 1 st Charkra temple Friday Sept 3, 2 to 4 PM. \r\nMany women seek the solace of the Sisterhood to help help empower and reclaim their sacred feminine wounded from male violation. \r\n\r\nWhile useful in diminishing shame and guilt, women sometimes fuel the \"righteous\" rage and distrust for the male energy as well. Power at the expense of your innermost yearnings.\r\n\r\nIf you had an awful relationship with your Father, could your loving mother and sisters ever give you more than a band-aid for this wound to your feminine Spirit\r\n\r\nHow likely is it that holding soft kittens will ever heal you from a fear of Dogs after being severely mauled.\r\n\r\nIn this ceremony, 2 or 3 women will be selected as surrogates for the other participants. They will be transported into an ecstatic bliss and utter rapture that will eclipse the usual, more directly sexual Tantric offerings as this work awakens your deepest sexual goddess but does not \"tamper\" with you.\r\n\r\nAll women are beautiful and sacred temples. They are the bearers of LIFE and are complete in ways that 'Testosterone poisoned' men can never be. Men manifest in the world by by force of will & external action whereas Women actually manifest the world. I hold women sacrosanct.\r\n\r\nHere are some testimonials. I hope from these alone that you will trust your intuition and receive Divine masculine flow as atonement for all the men who have abandoned, wounded, violated and trespassed against your sacred, sensual, sexual feminine Spirit in any manner.\r\nhere is a common experience of the work.\r\n\r\n... ... I can recall the state I found myself in while you were working on me. It allows me to return to that\r\nplace of consciousness where everything is allowed, nothing is resisted and the\r\ndeep longing I feel meets desire in every other molecule around me. Under your\r\ntouch there was hardly a you and a me.\r\nThere was just an experience of a fundamental vibration of Love",

Yes, we invented booze last year.  We then shook it all up and sprayed it with dust and threw snow-balls at it.  There was much fun and silliness.  Many dirty hippies were washed with lofted snowballs and alcohol.  Many camps, bars, and \"smarty-pants\" were straight snow-bombed because they didn't like Santa.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember, when Santa comes a-knocking, those bottles better be a-pouring.  \r\nThese Santas will make your camp a-rocking, even if you wanted it to stay a-snoring.\r\nWe can't stop the Santa a-cocking, with enough booze though, we'll be Santa a-flooring!\r\nMany people will be Santa a-gawking, but share a drink, please!

Hopefully, as you traveled around the city during the week you ran across someone else wearing/displaying a flower matching your color and you introduced yourself. Maybe there was an attraction there and as you parted you invited them to meet you at The Booby Bar in Terminal City village right after the burn on Saturday night. Ah romance! Or maybe the city was just too big and you didn't see another flower all week. No worries! The playa winds will be gently nudging all the flowers back to one of the hottest parties all week. So join the masses in a riot of colors and dance to the best cover songs on the planet!",

Times are approximate ... we'll have the stand open from when we wake up till we get tired.  We also appreciate gifts of bags of ice.  (Must be unopened)  Look for the pink flamingoes and the pink RV known as \"The USS Nancy Reagan\"",

During the heat of the day, in triple digit temperatures, one must eat a helping of five-alarm chili, cooked with the dreaded Guatemalan insanity pepper (grown only by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum). Then, to wash it down, a shot of hot pepper vodka, also infused with the same insanely hot pepper. Now, when you want nothing more than an ice-cold beverage to quench the fire burning in your mouth, you instead must chug a cheap, warm beer that's been sitting out in the sun since daybreak.\r\n\r\nWhy, might you ask, would anyone want to do this? Hell if we know! It's a terrible idea! It's a horrible thing to conceive, much less do on purpose! Yet, as demonstrated by the droves of people who participated AND completed the challenge in 2009, we apparently underestimated human nature. Not only did crowds show up for the challenge, but they returned over the course of the week to to share the pain with their friends. And by share, we mean point and laugh while grown men cried and stumbled down the street in a daze. We even had a university anthropologist come hangout, just to observe this odd aspect of human behavior. How could we not bring this back for 2010?",

Before we knew it another group started towards the man with us. We all outstretched our arms and slowly began spinning... As I spun faster and faster I started noticing the horizon line as it changed from dark to light dark to light. I started loosing my sense of where I was and this only made me want to spin faster. I could hear my friends giggling out of one ear then the other one then the other like stereo speakers. Trying to maintain my balance I spun as fast as I could and for as long as possible until I collapsed in a puddle of laughter. As the world spun around me all my friends stumbled toward me and fell upon me into a giant coodle. \r\n\r\nI thought it would be fun share this experience and see a large group of ppl together spinning at sunrise.

We’ve seen some amazing stickers, patches, pins, t-shirts, scarves, cups, mugs, cast metal pendants, glass icons... For those interested in collecting images and ideas to decorate our default world and remind us to smile and remember, SwagExchange is a place for visitors to exchange stickers, patches, pins, and other event swag. We’ll have an honor-system table in the Cityscape Lounge for participants to leave what they can, take what they like, and talk about all the cool stuff they’ve seen. Just like last year, Above The Limit is offering a variety of different and colorful souvenirs, so if you’re a serious collector or someone whose computer monitor or cube wall needs a reminder of something much more fun, come on by!",

Give in to your wanderlust - come learn how!\r\n\r\nCamp Nomadia founders Seeder & Serolynne (www.technomadia.com) have been living together technomadically since May 2007, having giving up their conventional fixed homes to create a conscious merging of life, work, sustainable living, travel, community and adventure.  They currently base their adventures out of their custom built, solar-powered, and thoroughly geeked-out 17’ fiberglass trailer. Their geographic flexibility has allowed them to travel back and forth across the continent, attending interesting events (and regional burns!), meeting amazing people, and seeing incredible things -- all without sacrificing their ability to run their software development and consulting business, or lessening their ties to friends, family, and community.\r\n\r\nSome of the other experienced technomads from Camp Nomadia will also be sharing their stories, offering up practical advice and insights to help others make the leap to a life without a fixed home base.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will focus on practical tips on how to leave a fixed-place existence behind and explore a life of technomadism. Topics covered will include selecting the right arsenal of technology to work successfully on the road, constructing your ideal mobile home (wheels, sails, backpacks, or...), and legal issues such as domicile, voting, vehicle registration, and taxes.\r\nImmediately after the Technomadic Lifestyle Workshop there will be a Nomadic Happy Hour, so plan to hang around to mix and mingle with a bunch of other current and future nomads.\r\n\r\nCamp Nomadia is intentionally unplaced this (our third) year, so check for our on-playa location at Playa Info (and likely on our website as well) and come find us.",

Come lay on the playa within the Heart Machine for a night of choreographed fire!  \r\n\r\nEvery other night the Heart Machine operates by will of the people and their interactions with its nervous system.  For one special night the Order of the Machinists will take over the Heart Machine and treat our Metropolis citizens to a choreographed fire show. \r\n\r\nThe Heart Machine needs human contact and interaction so we welcome you to sit, lay, cuddle, hug or raise your voices within the perimeter of the Heart Machine.  Come bask in the heat - and there will be heat - of our 14 foot tall flaming arteries.  Did we mention these arteries shoot fire ranging from 2 feet to 20 feet?  Did we warn you about the sonic booms Canadian made solenoids make; who needs smoke signals when we can communicate with booms the sound of kettle drums?  \r\n\r\nThe Order of the Machinists hail from Ontario Canada and the Heart Machine is our gift to you: our Black Rock City community.  It's always good to come home!\r\n\r\nIf you have extra 100LB propane tanks you wish to donate for the night (we will give them back) we may event make larger and longer sonic flaming booms to keep you warm.",

You’ll discover the possibility of reconnection with your innate beauty, wholeness and be honest with yourself and and with others in a safe circle of love. You can discover those places you’ve felt stuck, while you are supported in letting go. You learn to become aware of those times when you get in your own way, and come to see the choices open to you. You embrace what you desire the most, and deeply commit to letting your dreams and your visions be more important than you past wounds. \r\n\r\nYou will find yourself reconnecting with your innate beauty, wholeness and power in each moment.\r\n\r\nHeart of Now workshops include numerous assistants to support you and to create a sacred space for transformation. A deeply nurturing environment is created. This teamwork approach deepens the experience of service and camaraderie, where all are able to experience their vulnerabilities, allowing trust and growth.

    "description": "I have a small computer graveyard in my closet, and I bet I’m not the only one. Do you have an old laptop or keyboard and monitor taking up space? Put it to good use!\r\n\r\nImagine blocks of skyscrapers filled with little rooms where people, much like you and I spend most of their waking hours – moving their digits across letters on plastic pads with symbols on them.\r\n\r\nOur tools are now more advanced, with many flavors of computing, input and output devices, most of which are connected. These devices, and the possibilities they open up, have (with our help of course) developed marvelously diverse ways of subtly thieving away more and more of our time. Any metropolis today represents an ever-evolving symbiosis with technology.\r\n\r\nHelps us explore this topic on-Playa in 3 easy steps:\r\n1. Bring an old laptop or monitor/keyboard with you to Black Rock City this year.\r\n2. Show up at 7PM on Friday at the halfway point between the Man and Center Camp along the 6 o’clock avenue.\r\n3. We ask that you sit down forming a grid and look busy, typing for 20-25 minutes,\r\n\r\nWe will work with the town of Gerlach to set up techno-trash bins you can use on the way out, or if your device still works after the playa treatment, look into donating it to the Gerlach school district.\r\n\r\nMore details to come, but the core of the idea is really rather simple. Let's do a little exploration of how modern humans spend their time on this planet.\r\nThoughts and ideas, and of course participation are very welcome.",

The implications for both personal growth and societal balance from removing one of the key distortions of self knowledge will be explored. \r\n\r\nAlso, the (in)famous Hair Part Theory will be talked about, which explains why some people are so out of balance and why we have such a polarized culture.  The real reason why Al Gore lost the election, why Carter is a much better past president, why Andy Rooney, Steve Martin, Hitler, Blagoyovich and many other entertainment and political characters are so unusual, all find explanations with the way they part their hair. and of course, how mirrors have been fooling them even more so because they reflect the opposite hair part!",

It is a hybrid practice combining Yoga, Qi Gong, strength training, and healing to construct an effective, energy producing routine that uses isometric exercises to build muscle capability and core strength, while providing a sturdy platform for those muscles to operate from.  The routine focusses primarily on connecting the shoulders and hips to their associated muscle groups, and is an excellent departure point for peoples own search for health through a variety of healing practices - which are presented within the routine in an introductory manner. The benefits of this exercise style are most noticeable by those who perform tasks such as construction, labor, and computer work, or those who just want a tune-up.",

We will be galloping around making a nuisance of ourselves, stampeding through people's camps spreading our intolerably positive energy throughout the festival. We will start at the Unicorn Ranch at Esplanade and 3.45, gathering from 5-6pm, and then stampeding around who knows where as the sun sets.

The piano is fully functional (via electronic keyboard) and has a bench wrapping around one of its sides for musicians to sit on. Our intent is to around the playa, searching out musical, artistic, vocal, and spoken word collaborators, and creating dynamic collaborative music. We'd like to record some of these collaborations, and give mixed CDs out on playa on Sunday or via the Internet after the festival.\r\n\r\nTrue to its name, the Wandering Hands Piano Bar is also a bar, so we invite those who would like to sit back and listen to the music to climb inside the piano into the central seating area and enjoy a fine concoction from our bartender.",

Come to this 90-minute class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms: flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right. With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms® opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy. In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive. Taught by Douglas Drummond",

Come to this 90-minute class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms:  flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right.  With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms® opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy.  In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.  Taught by Stacey Butcher.",

Combining traditional archaeological methods with ethnographic approaches, researchers are collecting and analyzing information about the construction, use, and understanding of the physical environment and the lives and interactions of people within that temporary city. Archaeological methods consist of survey, mapping of individual camps, and surface collection of the city as constructed during the festival. This data will be combined with the results of data collection from the clean-up efforts overseen by the Bureau of Land Management. Ethnographic methods include structured and open-ended interviews, participant observation, virtual ethnography, discourse analysis, and secondary research.  Ethnographic findings will be integrated with archaeological data to present a holistic study of Burning Man. In merging archaeological and ethnographic approaches, this project combines analysis of the physical elements of the city with an exploration of the meanings of space and the festival in larger context. Research questions address the creation, use, and significance of physical space and place, the relationship between participants and their environment, temporality and change in ritual practice, and perceptions of self in relation to the landscape.

Since popping up the laptop and logging on isn't an option, we'll just have ourselves an addiction party instead.\r\n\r\nOpen to all everyone, gamer or not, we'll have a little gathering Saturday afternoon. Anyone who has completed our daily quests, or just wants to hang out and get their fix is welcome. Our resident mad alchemist has come up with some special brews, and servings of delicious chocolate cake are available to all. If any of our \"Dragonbreath\" chili remains, it's a great time to polish that off. Hang out, drink some \"kungaloosh\", take down a \"sulfuron slammer\", and swap war stories of \"How I wiped the 40 man raid\".",

    "description": "Zaireeka Listening Party: Experiments with Sound, Revival\r\nZaireeka is the eighth studio album by the alternative rock band The Flaming Lips. Released on October 28, 1997, the experimental rock album consists of four compact discs. Each of its eight songs consists of four stereo tracks, one from each CD. The album was designed so that when played simultaneously on four separate audio systems, the four CDs would produce a harmonic or juxtaposed sound. The discs may be included in different combinations, omitting one, two or three discs. The album's title is a portmanteau of two words: Zaire, chosen as a symbol of anarchy after Wayne Coyne heard a radio news story about the political instability of the African nation, and eureka (literally: \"I have found it\"), an expression of joyous discovery.\r\nSince its release a fifth disc has been added, adding a new element to the experiment.\r\nLeading up to it's release, the Lips would conduct parking garage, and ballroom experiments using car stereos and boom boxes to coordinate massive simultaneous sound experiments using the sounds that would eventually become Zaireeka.\r\nI propose to invite any interested booxbox/ mp3player toting burners to bring along their audio device, I will distribute the 5 discs (sets of mp3s) to everyone, divided up into groups, and (huddle into the dome perhaps) for some freaked out sounds. i will act as conductor, signaling when each group is to crank their disc, etc. we can try can waves of volume, mix up groups, or keep them segregated, their are many options left open for these wacky tracks!",

    "description": "After a regeneration period post temple sacrifice in BM'09 (Hope), ShiZaru's Evolving Ema (interactive art exhibit Y2) revied & successfully debuted at NYC Decom'09 as 改善(KAIZEN) with prompts this year that ask participants to reflect on the state of their metropolis through the lens of KaiZen, or continual improvement. Throughout the '09-'10 BM year, the Ema has appeared at numerous BM & community events, underground parties and fundraisers. Ema contributions from this past year will be incorporated as part of this year's installation on playa & after combined with the new Emas created by the denizens of our BRC in 2010, will again be sacrificed at the temple burn. \r\n\r\nAll are encouraged to come & seek or share enlightenment, as well as support the production, care and ceremonies that will be undertaken this BM'10. Do please visit, reflect and if inspired, contribute by adding UR creation.",
