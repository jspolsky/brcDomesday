It is often signaled the completion of one's set.\r\n\r\nPower moves are acrobatic moves that require momentum, speed, endurance, strength, and control creating circular momentum. (advanced)\r\n\r\nFlavor is about combining all the elements, learning musicality, and developing one's own style.\r\n\r\nLast 15 minutes of class, all participants will join together in a fun dance cypher to let loose and show what they've learned.",

Miso paste is also high in amino acids, the basic building blocks of protein. An excellent source of vitamin K and a decent source of riboflavin (38% DV), miso also provides small amounts of other vitamins. One major benefit of miso is its extremely high omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content.\r\nWe believe Miso saves Burners life on the Playa and leave them with good health all day.",

We have provided a motel motif that includes clean bedding, an ice bucket, and other classic motel environs to promote what adults do in such situations.  At the same time, their shadows are projected on the fabric walls to entertain the outside guests with their ‘shadow play.’  This is the perfect melding of the voyeurs and exhibitionists that populate BRC.  For many of our previous guests, our motel has provided them an opportunity to do something they may have only dream of prior, but in a playful and anonymous manner.  This is our contribution to what we consider one of the most important aspects to a great BM experience; it is not a spectator sport!\r\nAlso - there will be free CDs - Our gift to you!!!",

It's time to take it to The Man and let him, and everyone else know, who we are, and where in the hell we stand, dammit...\r\n\r\nAlieNVation!\r\n\r\nPlease join your fellow Nevada Burners in Black Rock City for a distinguished group photo at 4pm SHARP on Thurdsay, August 30, at The Man (6:00 side).\r\n\r\nOf course, please don your finest what-not as representative of being a so-called \"Nevadan,\" hahaha!\r\n\r\nParticiparty will ensue surrounding this photo shoot.  Mingling, stories, amazing feats, rousing spirituals, ...and booze and music too!\r\n\r\nPlease bring all your fellow Nevada Burner kin, from whatever state, nation, or planet they originally sprouted from.\r\n\r\nThe group photo will be freely available to download following the Burning Man, and you can still see the photos of previous years, all here:\r\n\r\ntinyurl.com/NevadaBurnersPhotoShoot",

Also explored is the role of mysticism and metaphor in the language of alchemical principles, wherein these descriptions are an allegory for spiritual human transformation as described by C.G. Jung and others. The development of images, art forms, and physical scientific practices is noted, as is the impact of this mystical practice on fields as diverse as medicine, chemistry, and meditation. Please join us for this deep look at alchemy as an idea, an act of art making, and a rebellious act of defiance.\"",

At the kickoff, you get a character, a prop, a line of dialogue, and a genre, all to include in your movie. 48 hours later, the movie must be complete. Then it will be shown at our \"On the Red Carpet Premiere\" on Thursday evening, August 30th at 11 PM at our Playa Theater (with an Encore Show on Friday, August 31st at 10 PM). If you have a team and equipment, start at your leisure and follow the instructions on posters found at PlayaInfo and Videogasm (in Snowflake Village).  If you want to get people for your team or join a team, come on down to Videogasm at 8:15 and Edelweiss in Snowflake Village on Tuesday at 3pm. The 48 Hour Film Project's mission is to advance filmmaking and promote filmmakers. Through its festivals the Project encourages filmmakers and would-be filmmakers to get out there and make movies. The tight deadline of 48 hours puts the focus squarely on the filmmakers—emphasizing creativity and teamwork skills. While the time limit places an unusual restriction on the filmmakers, it is also liberating by putting an emphasis on \"doing\" instead of \"talking.\"Note: Anyone making a video must first fill out a personal use form and get a camera tag from Media Mecca in Center Camp.",

Join guest teacher from Berlin, Germany Dagmar Cee for this 2 hour class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms: flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right. With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy. In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.5rhythms-berlin.de/",

Romances, of course!\r\n\r\nHere’s how it works: come by and just watch if you like. Then if you decide you’d like to participate throw your name into one or more of the following hats: “straight male, straight female, gay male, or lesbian female.” When it’s time for a new scene we will decide whether it’s straight, gay, or lesbian (based on interest) and draw two names out of the appropriate hat(s) to determine who from the audience will play the two romantic leads. Then we will view a scene from a romance movie, “the kiss”, the scene in the movie where the leads “connect.”\r\n\r\nAfter viewing this scene, our Baggage Check film director will direct the two randomly selected volunteers from the audience in recreating this scene, acting out the roles of the romantic leads, while our film crew captures the moment. For example, we might announce that the next scene will be a straight scene and we'd draw names from the straight male and straight female hats. Then we'd announce the movie as, for example, African Queen, and the man and woman selected would play the roles of Humphrey Bogart and Kathrine Hepburn. We would watch the scene on the boat when they've just successfully run the rapids and they kiss for the first time. Then the chosen actors would act out that scene.\r\n\r\nThen while we repeat this process for more scenes we will edit the results of earlier scenes so that we can view them later in the evening, as they are edited.",

Art may also be committed to the Home, just put it securely in place and say good-bye.

It's like the \"I have a dream\" speech but with instruments! the MOOPsquad will be with us, drinks will be available...\r\n\r\nI am a little worried that some things are going to get a little out of hand.... but that's what we all came for, isn't it?\r\n\r\nCome and jam with us in the BADLANDS Funk Dome!",

Greeting is the one and only chance to communicate with each and every participant on a one-on-one basis, mano-a-mano, facia-a-facia.\r\n\r\nArmed with wit, wisdom and infectious exuberance, Greeters take advantage of this opportunity by becoming skilled information providers conducting helpful, informational workshops to carloads of people.",

It creates a sense of a real city with street lamps and invokes an old tradition of lamplighting that contrasts nicely with the technical innovations of today. Check out this awesome blogpost to learn more about the history of lamplighting at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nHttp://blog.burningman.com/2010/06metropol/lamplighting-ritualizing-\tfunctional-necessity. \r\n\r\nThe Lamplighters draw more than 100 participants every evening of the event. In 1993 there were a dozen lanterns; now there are nearly 1000 to lift onto the spires that line the Esplanade pathways to the Man. To accomplish this considerable task, they ask for your help, and this year, they are inviting Black Rock Scouts and their parents to be a part of this community, this event, and their tradition. By the time the event ends, more than 1000 people will have helped the Lamplighters accomplish their important work.",

Scouts and their parents will tour the air conditioned facility and learn about what types of medical care is available at the Med Center. Scouts will meet at BRS headquarters and walk or bike to the Med Center on Esplanade (maybe ride if a vehicle is available). \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Emergency Services Department: \r\n\r\nBlack Rock City's Emergency Services Department (ESD) is there when you need them months before the event officially starts, and is on-duty well after the last participant leaves to support the playa clean-up efforts. ESD provides Black Rock City with several different key areas of service; these services include Fire Fighting, Rescue, Hazardous Materials, Emergency and Non-Emergency Medical evaluation and treatment, Mental Health services (including sexual assault response), 911 Dispatch, and providing the two-way radio communications infrastructure for all of Black Rock City.",

    "description": "Description: \r\n\r\n In 2011 Black Rock Scouts and Kidsville visited the Pier as part of the Art Tour, and the Pier was selected as \"Kids Choice Award\" for best Art installation. In 2012 we have planned visits to the Pier 2.0 on Tuesday during the Night Art Tour, and possibly on Wednesday during the Day Art Tour, but these two visits will only be appetizers before the Main Pier 2.0 Event. Friday will be a dedicated visit to Pier 2.0 and at the end of the pier, there will be a Spanish Galleon shipwreck we can all explore. Transportation will be in large fanciful ships, boats, and vessels. The Pier crew will meet us in pirate garb and speak and provide us our own personal tour. We will be climbing through the Spanish galleon wreck and search for clues to the occupants. Michelle, a member of the Pier’s building crew (and an burner parent) will be hosting the event and explaining the artifacts.\r\n\r\nAbout Pier 2.0\r\n\r\n\r\nPier 2 is a magnification of Pier 1 in 2011. This is the second chapter in the life of a beloved piece of art. The stage for serendipity is now a launching pad for a grand tale as told through the remnants of a dead ship. Their intention is to create a story out of our art. They are replacing the words with experience and the chapters with exploration. Pier 2 will consist of 2 components: The Pier and The Ship. You can read more about the Pier 2.0 on their facebook page here:  \r\n\r\n http://www.facebook.com/ThePier2012",

Come over and visit us and let's relax and congregate together.\r\n\r\nI do need some help from you all on here. No money needed but I will ask this, since I do not have it in the budget for mass booze (some booze just not a mass) and beer, I must ask that you bring your cup and whatever you have laying around your camp that will get you off and that you are willing to share with you friend here at the Burners Against Scalpers Party. If you have extra, and want to donate to this on playa event, just bring it to the meet and greet and we can mix it into something.

And there’s much more to it than just “reproduce this!” We can help you grow and hone your fertile sense of humor. Anyone can do this!  We welcome all levels of skill; you do not need to have any prior training or experience.  Learn all the basic skills like character creation, layout, composition, perspective, and writing. Then take your talent to the next level or even to climactic heights beyond! Brush up on advanced techniques like human and animal figure drawing, proportion, and color.  We end with an improvisational art game using the cartooning skills we've learned. Bring your own sharp pencil or handle one of ours. We’ll also provide the clean sheets (of paper) for you to perfect your best work.",

    "description": "Kostume Kult has been \"Costuming the Naked\" since 2002 with donations from costume companies, theater groups and burners like you who help us recycle their old costumes and freaky fashions. Here we empower people with new attitude to be birthed down our runway, with the encouragement of our MCs and DJs, onto the Esplanade and into their new lives.\r\n\r\nThe rules are simple. \r\n \r\n1. The stuff is free.  No returns or barter required although we do encourage recycling old costumes through us. \r\n\r\n2. You must wear what you want to take with you.  We are not giving \"product\" but \"experience\" and transformation is what is being offered-- not a consumerist feeding frenzy. (Decommodification)\r\n \r\n3.  If you have found something truly wonderful that makes your heart go pitter-patter... Consider giving it to the person next to you.  Generosity trumps the accumulation of stuff. (Gifting)\r\n\r\n4.  If you are looking for something specific, coming in with an agenda, you will not find it.  We aint got it. (and we might actually hide it from you! ;) Come in with an open mind to mix and match and be silly (Immediacy).\r\n\r\n4.  Donated costumes can be moopy.  Please help us keep the playa perfect and consciously dispose of all tags, loose threads and packaging. (Leave No Trace)\r\n\r\n5. Go forth onto the playa ready to participate and express yourself more fully.  Costume is the mix of fashion and theater and the playa is one big-ass stage.  After our runway, be prepared to make new connections in your new costumed persona or upgraded burner attitude.  (Participation and Radical Self Expression)",

(OK, Marie Curie was a notable exception, but she was HOT. Talk about a nuclear family!) So ya see, what comes around, goes around. \r\n\r\nThe Critical Dicks March welcomes all genders: Male, Female, Transsexual, Intersexual, Pansexual, Gay, Bi, Straight, and Bent. However, if you are not naturally blessed with a dick, please bring a long a reasonable fucsimile. \r\n\r\nAnd now, let the testosterone flow! Stand proud and erect as you march through the streets of Black Rock City! Cast of the cruel duds of oppression! You have nothing to lose but your shame!\r\n\r\nThe Critical Dicks March has a long history, and is best pulled off in protest fashion, so now is the time to stand up tall and demand equal rights for your Dick!!!",

    "description": "Critical Tits- topless bike procession has been a life-changing tradition since 1996 and is an unforgettable high-point of the week for all women who want to have the experience of being celebrated as Goddesses,Sisters, Mothers, Daughters,or female members of the human race. The critical mass is thousands of women who proudly ride in this procession to create a wave of joy for themselves, each other, and the respectful bystanders who cheer them on their way.Please consider the privacy of the riders in this huge parade when tempted to take photos or videos without the women's permission.\r\nCelebrate your creativity with artful decorations,glitter,paint,be yourself to the max! Fertility is the perfect theme to participate in this joyful event, or come out to the parade route and cheer the Goddesses on! \r\nAn unforgettable, life-changing ritual is planned at the end of the ride, don't miss it. \r\n\r\nHistory of Critical Tits:\r\nThe ride started in 1996 on a day when the Critical Mass ride was taking place in San Francisco. Five of us painted our chests, got on our bikes and rode through BRC shouting “Critical Tits.” Women joined us and men bowed down. Each year since then the ride has more or less doubled in size. We had 5000+ riders in previous years.\r\n\r\nObviously something about the experience resonates with women. We are the largest gathering of women on the playa, and for many of us, the experience offers a meaningful connection to the power of female energy within ourselves and within our playa community.\r\n\r\nQ: When is the ride?\r\n\r\nA: The ride starts at 4 pm on Friday at the Man. Please respect the fact that the ride is for women and girls only.\r\n\r\nQ: What happens at the end of the ride?\r\n\r\nA: Each year, the ride ends in a different manner. The end-of-ride event is meant as an opportunity for women to connect with and celebrate each other.",

    "event_id": 7965,
    "description": "Self expression is cool: flailing, head banging and stochastic gyration is all good fun. But communication is hard if our self expression is not understood. This class aims to cut to the chase and help you build your own vocabulary that reflects you, while imposing as little orthodox structure on your creativity as possible. Where most dance lessons focus on the vocabulary of dance, in this class you will have the opportunity to explore the phonemes of dance. These are the small bits that can be assembled into dance moves, just like we assemble phonemes into words that can be understood by others. Understanding these concepts renders the need to distinguish between one style/vocabulary and another far less important and makes the fusion of many styles and techniques much, much easier. It's like being able to read the phonetic alphabet, or seeing the green lines of binary code behind the Matrix. \r\n\r\nSo here's how it works: We're going to start off with a half an hour or so of these kinetic phonemes (little bits) and we're going to splice in some practice dances to solidify the concepts. Then your teachers are going to to DJ a set using some of the music you've practiced with and employing a playlist designed to illustrate how the social dances can be adapted to a wide variety of cool stuff. So cool in fact, that you will probably want to write down and download when you get home. (or you will experience a rush of feel-good chemicals because you're already familiar with such cool music and that will make you feel cool even though your self-perception is an illusion of your temporal brain chemistry.) During this dance, you may ask your teachers and any other veteran social dancers who may be attending for advice and technique. There won't be any dance etiquette at play here and the next scheduled dance that follows may well be in the nude, so relax, get over yourself and let's have fun.",

    "description": "Native American tradition, blindfold dance, global music, hands on healing: powerful soul work to shed inhibitions and heighten inner awareness.\r\n\r\nJoin us on this unforgettable tribal SOUL journey as we create a ritual celebration that fuses dance and contemporary shamanism. This unique form of movement therapy heals and frees physical, mental, emotional and spiritual blockages, blurring the lines between club culture, dance, music and internal exploration by tuning in to sound, movement, and the trance-like journey of self-discovery and self-realization! This mystical, inspirational and fun process modernizes ancient shamanic journeying techniques of drumming and the ritualistic use of the blindfold. With the Shamanic safe space set and a personal intention declared, you blindfold yourself to enter an individual experience of self-expression and inner awakening. The music brings you into yourself and encourages you to explore the unknown, the darkness where we transcend into deeper states of consciousness - where there is freedom to scream, cry, meditate, dance and everything in between -  with the available assistance of the leader and the gatekeepers. Throughout the dance, the leader may apply energetic healing by intuitively approaching dancers, but without the use of touch. Eventually the music brings us back home here on earth, and dancers relax upon the ground to receive hands on healing. Side by side, though in our own inner world, through this journey we each are given the chance to experiencing our sacred \"Vision Quest\". We dance our intention and seek to better understand our Soul's purpose. \r\n\r\nFirst-time gatekeepers encouraged to volunteer to help keep dancers safe during the dance - this is generally done energetically, though light touch may be used if necessary. All our welcome on this journey, however, you must be on time. This is  a respectful, safe and sacred event.",

    "description": "We have put together one of the best Dark Side of the Moon/ Wizard of Oz mashups you will ever see.  \r\nWe researched and experimented with many albums to complete the movie.  Be sure to stay to The End for \r\none of the most perfect synchronizations in the entire movie!\r\n\r\nsynchronize: To cause (soundtrack and action) to match exactly in a film.\r\nsynchronicity: Coincidence of events that seem to be meaningfully related, \r\nconceived in Jungian theory as an explanatory principle on the same order as causality.\r\n\r\nThis mashup is a sublime example of synchronization and synchroncity.  \r\n\r\nSynchronicity bewteen albums and movies is relatively easy to find. Often times the mood of a musical\r\npiece can be flexible enough to fit with many scenes in a movie.  But in this case, the mood of \r\nthe various Pink Floyd albums across the course of the scenes in The Wizard of Oz seem to synchronize \r\nwith the mood of the movie perfectly.\r\n\r\nSynchronization is more difficult to find between an album and a movie. Of course you can adjust the start\r\npoint of a movie to create artificial synchronizations but you would not necessarily expect many other\r\ncomponents to align.   However, in this mashup you find absolutely amazing synchronized scenes.  At the risk\r\nof spoiling some surprises ... be sure to pay attention to the music and in particular the timing of the silences \r\nafter Dorothy's house lands in Oz.  Also, pay attention to the ends of songs and note how more often than not\r\nthe song ends align with scene ends.  The synchronizations is so tight it makes you wonder how this could ever be \r\nconicidence.  Was this designed by Pink Floyd?  All band members vehemently deny this.\r\n\r\nWe will have some seating available but you also might want to consider bringing a chair/blanket/pillow.\r\n\r\nThe movie will start at 8:30PM (after sunset when full dark has set in.)",

It is an adventurous way of life--physically, emotionally and mentally that citizens of BRC embrace.\r\n\r\nOur shows are an opportunity for Dark Sparklers and other BRC citizens to explore and showcase their Dark Sparkle through performance, storytelling, and tease. Featuring Nicki Sparxx! Father Figure! Roxy Pop! La Chispa! Red Siren! StraighNasty! and many more. We'll also turn the tables with ample opportunity for participation.",

No duds & no repeats like last year!!  Although I won't be sober, I have it arranged that a semi-sentient being will start the music on time!  Our trusty old favorite, tasty Ritz Crackers will be served.\r\nYou're on your own for cocktails although we usually bend the knee and pour a few for old friends as we spy them.  Also on the scene- our World Map that you can sign to make your attendance mark for all to see. Also our Playa famous gift tree, chock-a-block full of useful survival items.",

What are our responsibilities to keeping water clean and ensuring ample resources for all denominations of society? What are some strategies for engaging people in discussing and finding solutions for water quality and quantity issues? What role does spirituality play in terms of appreciating water and human behaviour towards water and environmental stewardship? We will explore and discuss these questions and more together. There will be examples presented from different places around the world (Singapore, San Antonio, TX, Bangladesh, etc...). We will then break out into groups to brainstorm what a local water ethic would look like in your watershed and prepare a fun pamphlet to educate and attract local citizens to join in the movement.",

We are designed to be living conduits of fundamental creative energy streaming forth and manifesting into form.  The question is, how much are we impeding or allowing these vital currents to move and dance their way through us in each moment?  When we dissolve the inevitable veneers accumulated from our societal conditioning, we find at the core an inherently ecstatic nature.  Often touched upon inconsistently in fleeting moments of unification, it beckons us forth as a song calling us home.  Discover how to get out of your own way, dissolving resistance and accessing this essential core in order to ecstatically birth the fullness of each moment from a state of pure presence.",

We will examine how entheogen use can cast a light on some of the most ancient and perplexing questions of the role of the Ego in our lives; and how the Ego creates our Society and technology, and how our modern view of the role of the Ego - in both our lives and our Society - will shape the future we will all live.",

We want all you electric people to show your colors and join us when we complete a CO2 shaped route on the open playa starting from the Man. With the help of a smartphone Application all can be part of a GPS CO2 shaped \"tag\" as we parade our way through Black Rock City. Essentially, we will all be live brushes, smartphone technology the paint and Black Rock City our playground and canvass.\r\n \r\nAnd if you prefer to enjoy your Burning Man experience off-line there is no need to download the APP. Just hop along and join the parade.\r\n\r\nThe concept stems from the experimental Art, Climate & Technology Project “CO2 Green Drive”. The CO2 Green Drive Project was devised in connection with the UN Climate Summit COP15 in Copenhagen/December 2009. Since 2009 the project has been performed 23 times in 19 cities on five continents \"tagging\" these with citywide CO2 \"paintings\". In April 2012 the project was performed simultaneously in 12 cities on five continents.\r\n\r\nUsing art and culture as a universal language CO2 Green Drive seeks to promote a sustainable and fertile future in all its aspects. It's time art shows the way via physically engaging, playfull and fun activities supporting abundant life everywhere. \r\n \r\nAround the world this has included bikers and skaters in Dakar, electric vehicles in New York and runners in India. Next Stop Nevada.\r\n \r\nAt Burning Man we hope to see lots of bikes, tri-bikes- quadro-bikes, pedestrians, stilt walkers, bunnies, things we don't even know how to name and electric art cars ... and, well, perhaps with a couple of zombies thrown in. As long as your mode of transportation is based on renewable technology we can’t wait to ROCK the dust with you.",

Each of these movies was made in 48 hours on the Playa. \"Cinderplaya\" features a wizard searching for his playa love. \"Portaman\" discovers a mastermind's plan to destroy Burningman. \"Sister Lucy\" helps burners learn about sex. During \"Abandon All Hope and Fear\", a dream teaches the way of the playa. More movies will be included. The 48 Hour Film Project's mission is to advance filmmaking and promote filmmakers. Through its festivals the Project encourages filmmakers and would-be filmmakers to get out there and make movies. The tight deadline of 48 hours puts the focus squarely on the filmmakers—emphasizing creativity and teamwork skills. While the time limit places an unusual restriction on the filmmakers, it is also liberating by putting an emphasis on \"doing\" instead of \"talking.\" At Videogasm in Snowflake Village at 8:15 & Edelweiss. Bring your own chair or tarp. Note, to join the BRC 48 Hour Film Project to help make a film, come to the kick-off at Videogasm on Tuesday, August 28th between 3-5 PM.",

    "event_id": 6525,
    "description": "This workshop, now in its 8th year on the playa, is an ultra-condensed form of a type of massage developed by the Body Electric School. It combines breathwork and a sequence of erotic massage techniques which stimulate erotic energy but don’t expend it in ejaculation. The result is often a heightened erotic state some people call a “full body orgasm,” which can go on for many minutes and can lead to all kinds of ecstasies, insights, and even spiritual experiences.  \r\n\r\nHere are a few guiding principles if you’re thinking of coming to the workshop (more at http://playajoy.org/?p=2758#more-2758):\r\n\r\n- Yes, participants get naked and give/receive erotic, genital massage.  So, this is only open to adults, and only participants – no spectators.\r\n\r\n- Givers of massage may be of any sex, receivers must have a penis. (One of the most powerful parts of this workshop is how gay, straight, & everyone else share erotic space together.)\r\n\r\n- You can come with a partner or try your luck at the workshop. Usually, about a dozen people come partnerless to each workshop.\r\n\r\n- There is no contact between participants other than the massage. This isn’t group sex (not that there's anything wrong with that!) Boundaries are maintained and respected. We even ask that givers not look around the room — receivers can feel it when you’re not tuned in.\r\n\r\n- Bring water, a towel and WetOnes for optimal pleasure. Pee ahead of time. Some people like to be blindfolded – bring a bandana or blindfold if you like.  Bring breath mints to gift to others!\r\n\r\n- Last year we had a line around the block a full hour before the workshop started. So, come early!\r\n\r\n- Unfortunately, we don’t have time to do two full workshops, so you’ll either give or receive, but not both. Both are hot!\r\n\r\nSee you on the playa!",

Humans were created from RA's tears and sweat.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians often referred to the sun and the moon as the \"eye\"s of particular gods. RA's right eye was equated with the sun, and his left eye equated with the moon.\r\n\r\nThe Eye of RA therefore, can also take the form of a goddess: the mother who brings RA forth. RA was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of Fertility 2.0, we must pay homage to RA at night with the moon in full, before he is born again at dawn Friday morning.\r\n\r\nEgyptian attire is requested for our evening Eye of Ra party. Come as Cleopatra, Marc Anthony, Pharaoh, or any of your favorite Ancient Egyptian Gods and Goddesses to prove your dedication to Ra and be protected until eternity. \r\n\r\n8 PM Sophie Rae \r\n9 PM Jonny Quest \r\n10 PM Just J \r\n11 PM Jefr Tale and Str!pe \r\n12 AM Myagi \r\n1 AM Dylan Rhymes \r\n2 AM Donald Glaude \r\n3 AM Hatiras \r\n4 AM The Scumfrog \r\n5 AM Brian Williams \r\n6 AM Dustin Sheridan \r\n\r\nAnd your dedication to RA by displaying your Egyptian attire will not go unnoticed, as the Eye of RA sees all. Please find the arm of RA, a Pharaoh by the name of Cameron and he will reward you with a playa gift amulet that would make RA himself jealous. \r\n\r\nI now bid you safe passage on your way from the default world to our underworld.",

    "description": "Due to the extra traffic of our bourgeoning population pouring into the playa, the dust is expected to be much worse this year, so much so that they’re calling it Futility 2.0. Even the Black Rock Rangers have faltered as their ranks have questioned their resolve in the face of such a menace. They need not fear, for The French Maid Brigade will once again provide their services gratis to the community of Black Rock City. Once again our citizens can rest assured that they will be protected from any and all dusty intrusions. \r\n\r\nEach year one or two rookie French Maids spend extra time addressing the situation with the Rangers only to realize, “Wait, they actually dress to look like dust!” Indeed, if you could magnify a dust particle five billion times, you would see the likeness of a Black Rock Ranger. Clearly the Rangers have succumbed to the mentality of “If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.\" The French Maids have no such intentions with dust, will never surrender, and continue to support the radical self-expression of all who dwell on the playa through maintaining a dust-free environment for all who participate.\r\n\r\nMany enquiries are made every year as to how one might join such a venerable organization. You too can be one of the sexiest clean freaks on the playa. Stop by our camp anytime for official recruitment or rendezvous with us on the playa. Please bring: non-feather dusters, rags, dustbusters, service carts, vacuums, white gloves, latex gloves, enema kits, lube, any other useful cleaning equipment, and your worst possible French accent. On Thursday at 2:00 pm we meet at 3 O’Clock and Esplanade then dust our way through every filthy, nasty camp on our march toward that dust bucket known as Center Camp Café, liberate them from their dusty oppression, and celebrate our triumph!",

    "description": "Glass Camp is a highly interactive project. Glass blowing is a mesmerizing art in itself. While it’s an art form dating backing to the birth of humanity, it’s still relatively new in the United States. The glow of a molten, honey-like material at night is hypnotic. The radiant heat of the equipment illuminating the hot shop floor is an installation in itself. Glass is a dance, with each team developing its own choreography. We intend to include the audience with ‘You Name It, We Make It’ activities. People can submit a design and our collection of talented artists will assemble what was not thought possible. Our team consists of some of the most skilled emerging and established artists in Seattle, the mecca for glass working in the world. Each night the team will take at least 2 complex designs from the audience and take the 2-D drawing and pull the 3-D design from the hot glass. There is no limit to what can be achieved in glass, and that’s what we intend to show. Glass blowing began in the Fertile Crescent and we hope to take it to Fertility 2.0. These professional artists are encyclopedias of information to anything relating to glass and high temperatures. With the making of glass, questions always arise, and we are equipped with the information to help people understand. All of our equipment was handmade by Evan Schuass, and was used last year in the Keyhole. Mobile glass studios are an excellent display of design, function, and efficiently. He has been commissioned from people all over the West Coast, and Hawaii to build these mobile shops. All the people included in Glass Camp are either producing artists or assistants to the highest level of glass workers in the world. We would like to share our gift and knowledge with the people of Burning Man. Everyone in this camp is here because they have a passion for glass art.",

Here's the scoop from Cindy Ulch, Supervisor with the Nevada State Health Divisions Public Health and Clinical Services Environmental Health Program:\r\n\r\nThe only application any camp needs is the \"Food Permit Application for Burning Man\" found here:\r\nhttp://health.nv.gov/BFHS_EHS.htm \r\n\r\nDon't wait until the last minute.

The most interesting practice would be turning your thought toward him for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy. I'll be happy if we could find any great idea to make better and more enjoyable future throughout this tea ceremony. Furthermore, I will do something interesting in San Francisco before Burning Man this year. Please join us if you have time before you are headed for the playa For more detail, please visit the following links. Ken Hamazaki Red Museum http://www.kenhamazaki.jp/",

The 2009 version of this event won the Acculturation Video award from Burning Man (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtX8Z-izffs\\).

It is brought to each participant by the tautua'ava, or 'ava server, in the order proscribed by the tufa'ava, or 'ava distributor. Usually, the highest chief of the visiting party is served first, followed by the highest chief of the host party, and then service proceeds based on the rank of the rest of the participants. The drink is served in a polished coconut half. The overall ceremony is highly ritualized, with specific gestures and phrases to be used at various times.\r\n\r\nOur Kava ceremony will be a first come first serve event if the turnout is too overwhelming!

Start your evenings with the most intense laughter you can experience. We laugh for no reason, other than for exercise, and health. Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through laughter. It’s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits.

    "description": "I became interested in how the shamans utilized sound, chant and music to guide and affect trance states as well as healing. I practiced as a healer at our center (www.bluemorphotours.com), specializing in using ayahuasca and sound to heal depression and generate transcendent experience of consciousness. http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0603/features/peru.html 4 years ago I started to branch out from ayahuasca and sought to bring the unique qualities of ayahuasca shamanism to music. I wanted to use the music to guide trance states induced by the music. The theory was to guide people to heart, love and direct spiritual or transcendent experience without being told where or how to go. The music itself would guide through the mix of sounds. I started a music partnership with my wife Wendy, who is a 15 year opera, choir and rock singer to create the music. The mix of her traditional musical training with my traditional shamanic training allowed for the right combination to make the music possible.We blended the musical structure found in the shamanism to existing electronic genres like World Music and House. The music itself is electronic with vocals sung by Wendy and me.As for the burn, we have three distinct types of music we could perform. The first would be the chants and icaros of traditional amazonian shamanism (leading ceremonies for groups of people), the second would be to perform our world music and the third, our house music. In addition, lectures on ayahuasca shamanism and the traditional uses of ayahuasca, how it is practiced, apprenticeship, working with elders and the modern uses of ayahuasca for healing.  In addition I created a project called Modern Shamanism designed to create a unique form of shamanic/spiritual exploration for Modern people based out of modern life experience. I could lead trances/meditations through this practice. www.modernshamanism.org",

He’d taken a liking to Camp Brand Ur Ass, and its Houston contingent, the Rubber Chicken Camp - because Rubber Chickens are inherently funny; almost as funny as giraffes.  Anywho, He gave them the idea a couple of years ago to host a Lemon Heaven party - (omnipotent, remember? Sort of like Doctor Who, but without the TARDIS) and knew they’d picked up some lemons, vodka (for those of you wary of mixing), and some powdered lemon stuff, and said, “Yea, verily, thou shalt host another LEMON HEAVEN PARTY!” That was in his most impressive god voice.  He also knew they played excellent, party dance music. So, everyone who’s anyone, please join the Rubber Chicken Camp, at Camp Brand Ur Ass, on Thursday evening around 7-ish.",

    "description": "This workshop is a reasonably controlled testing of various dental-dam like products used as body-fluid barriers for clit licking.  For the test, the Lickee – with female anatomy - recruits one Licker with any anatomy, but with tongue ample in endurance and strength.  For each product, Lickee and Licker complete a questionnaire reporting various aspects of the product.  Each test takes about half-an-hour.  If Licker also has female anatomy, then doing a second test with Lickee/Licker roles reversed is fine.  Lickee may bring multiple Lickers, but only one Licker at a time will be permitted into the testing area.  The testing area is a group space, completely enclosed, with gym mats.  Lickee and Licker should bring towels, water, and good communication skills. Howlers should bring mufflers.  Use of the barriers is required, even if you are fluid bonded.  The object is to test the barriers.  No spectators. Photography and cell phone use are prohibited.  This is a drug free event (this includes tobacco and alcohol).  Remember:  It’s for SCIENCE!Adults only.",

Come for an early hour of low impact exercise in the Longevity Stick Art (LSA) discipline of 12 low-impact exercises to build balance, flexibility, strength, mental focus, breathing capacity, and vitality, and open your points and channels. Bring your water or hydration liquid. We’ll have sticks available for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed the Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese Army. He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain their health through LSA, and vowed that if he was ever freed, he would dedicate his life to spreading its benefits to the world, with the proviso that no future trainer could ever charge for the course. (Sounds like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, settled in Southern California, and started teaching classes of students and future teachers. Today, there are dozens of classes weekly around So Cal. Also, LSA is spreading around the US and world. Many more details are available at: www.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html and www.filmbaby.com/films/2341 Master Dao passed away late 2010 at age 89, and one of our campers was privileged to attend his funeral, and his last birthday party, a few months before.",

Miso paste is also high in amino acids, the basic building blocks of protein. An excellent source of vitamin K and a decent source of riboflavin (38% DV), miso also provides small amounts of other vitamins. One major benefit of miso is its extremely high omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content. We believe Miso saves Burners life on the Playa and leave them with good health all day.",

For years Andy has organized hosted naked comedy shows featuring Boston area comics doing stand-up in the nude. Andy's first naked comedy show in a public venue was at Improv Boston this past summer days before going to the Edinburgh Fringe in August. News of the event spread quickly and preceded his arrival in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\"A group of American comics have performed what could be the world's first naked stand-up show. The little-publicised event in Boston on Tuesday night was a sell-out.\"\r\n— Chortle\r\n\r\nAfter arriving in Scotland for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Andy seized an opportunity at Spank!, the late night comedy showcase at Smirnoff Underbelly, to do a 1 minute naked promo for the show that he was performing in called Why Work?. The overwhelming positive response at the event prompted Andy to host his Naked Comedy Showcase in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the success of the shows at Improv Boston and at The Fringe in Edinburgh, Andy has organized an ongoing monthly naked comedy show at Improv Boston. News of the show was reported in both of Boston's major newspapers:\r\n\r\n\"Once a month, [Andy] does onstage what most of us could only imagine in our worst nightmare: naked stand-up-comedy...What's more astonishing is that Ofiesh has persuaded other performers to try nude stand-up, too, and now hosts \"the Naked Comedy Showcase\" at Improv Boston the First Wednesday of every month.\"\r\n— Nick Zaino, Boston Globe\r\n\r\n\"Spectators who appreciated the comedy seemed to outnumber those who may have simply wanted to see naked people.\"\r\n— Sean L McCarthy, Boston Herald\r\n\r\nNow for the first time the Naked Comedy Showcase can be seen at Burning Man!!!",

We’ll be stopping off at Barbie Death Camp & Wine Bistro, Celestial Bodies, Camp Swede, and the Tiki Bar.  How many naked cyclists can we squeeze into a tiki bar?  Come help us break last year’s record.  We’ll also be hitting Duckpond for keg beer and some slip-’n-slide action.  As always, the famous naked bartenders of Comfort & Joy will be hosting the after party.  This ride isn’t just an event, it’s a tradition.  So if you’re willing to meet the dress code, join us for one of the silliest parties on the playa.  Trust us, after the first couple of cocktails you won’t mind being naked. \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in helping to steward the ride, contact us at dunneasley@hotmail.com.

We will be returning to the Burning Man festival for the first time since 2007, and need your help to make this happen. We’ve put together an amazing schedule of 22 speakers across 4 days which include luminaries such as Alex and Allyson Grey, Paul Stamets, Daniel Pinchbeck, Rick Doblin and many more. The talks will hosted by Camp Above the Limit and be located in the Crystal Cavern, a 40’ dome at 9:15 & B. \r\n\r\nCheck out the full schedule and audio from past lectures at: http://www.matrixmasters.com/pn/ \r\n\r\nPalenque Norte History\r\n\r\nThe Palenque Norte journey began with the legendary Entheobotany Conferences held at the Chan Kah hotel near the ancient Mayan ruins just outside of Palenque, Mexico. There, Terence McKenna, Jonathan Ott, Ann & Sasha Shulgin, and a host of other psychedelic luminaries passed along many insights, discoveries, and wild tales to the fortunate Tribe members who were there. And it was at the end of the pool where Terence McKenna gave some of his last talks at the Chan Kah.\r\n\r\nYears later, then in 2003, a few alumni from those conferences decided to have a \"Palenque reunion\" at the Burning Man Festival, and so we organized a theme camp and lecture series to continue the Palenque tradition.",

We can discuss our favorite red heads, play 'find the freckle,' and maybe even have a conan obrian look-alike contest!  Maybe it'll be a raucous shit show or maybe just a mob of burners constantly reapplying sun screen.  Let's find out!  With hundreds of gingers on the playa we're also looking to break the record for most gingers in a single place; the previous record is six. Note: Severely sun burnt burners do not count.  Also, this is a safe environment for gingers so no red-head-fetish onlookers please (unless you're a ginger too, in which case come on in).  If you're name is Ginger you can come we suppose.",

We will also have activities scheduled for fun at the bar, check out our schedule when you come by. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day.

Just as with a traditional piñata, if people strike the 'Living Piñata's body hard enough, treasures will 'bleed' forth.

Each of these movies was made in 48 hours on the Playa. \"Cinderplaya\" features a wizard searching for his Playa love. \"Portaman\" discovers a mastermind's plan to destroy Burningman. \"Sister Lucy\" helps Burners learn about sex. During \"Abandon All Hope and Fear\", a dream teaches the way of the Playa. More movies will be included. The 48 Hour Film Project's mission is to advance filmmaking and promote filmmakers. Through its festivals the Project encourages filmmakers and would-be filmmakers to get out there and make movies. The tight deadline of 48 hours puts the focus squarely on the filmmakers—emphasizing creativity and teamwork skills. While the time limit places an unusual restriction on the filmmakers, it is also liberating by putting an emphasis on \"doing\" instead of \"talking.\" At Videogasm in Snowflake Village at 8:15 & Edelweiss. Bring your own chair or tarp. Note, to join the BRC 48 Hour Film Project to help make a film, come to the kick-off at Videogasm on Tuesday, August 28th between 3-5 PM.",

The growing worldwide community of like minds continues to grow and intentionally gather to celebrate life and create positive change on the planet.  The project takes the pulse of the culture at transformational festivals around the world in 2012, including Symbiosis, Lightning in a Bottle, Desert Rocks, Sonic Bloom, Boom, Burning Man, Australia’s Eclipse 2012 and Belize Solstice 2012, and many more.  With the backdrop of these amazing festivals and communicated through the individual festival participants, we explore a variety of different themes, including activism, art, consciousness, environmentalism, music, mythology, technology, and 2012 as a general framework to better understand and define the culture. \r\nCome join us, give us your opinion and help make a difference in the Universe.",

Through this workshop, we identify the areas where there is no space and together, we learn to let go of the restrictions that are preventing us from opening our hips, our heart and our mind.  \r\n\r\nIn this 2.5 hour workshop, students are facilitated to the discovery of their very own myofascial restrictions, and guided on how to release them. This is where the magic happens. This is the shift begins.\r\n\r\nAshley and Bryon work on an individual level to isolate the physical and emotional blockages that restrict us from achieving our full potential in each yoga posture. This revolutionizing approach to understanding the body will propel you years ahead in your yoga practice. Forget the eons of prep classes; you can meet your goals overnight. Revolutionized Yoga is the optimal solution for yoga practitioners that are craving a real, a rapid, a wild and a drastic shift in their yoga practice and their life.\r\n\r\nTaught by Ashley Holly, MA, RYT and Bryon Brewster, CST, BCSI, MT, CHN, Osteopath, this workshop explores and shares the linkages between the connective tissue, fascia, movement and the asana.",

They are a pair of misfit artist comrades who have been seeding the giant robot sculpture concept since 1995 when they worked together on the original Armymen video game at the now defunct 3DO Company. Nick was awarded the first Distrikt art grant in December 2011 and the robot grew in his back yard in Alameda over the ensuing months attracting a superstar build team: Mark Wagner, Ken Dahl, Daimon Marchant, Mike Parisi, Nick Myerhoff, Richard McDougall, Woodson Martin. The collective experience of the team ranges from Guinness Book of World Record art creators to silicon valley computer science executives and engineers.\r\n\r\nDragun is a 20’ tall full-scale stylized version of a 1970’s Shogun Warrior (known as Jumbo Machinder) made of recycled plastic. It is an interactive, large scale art sculpture with completely different night and day visual aesthetics. The robot is adorned with three types of interactivity; sound, light and movement. He is controlled by wifi, motion sensor and a cable pulley system. Many discussions have taken place around his gender and it is still unknown.\r\n\r\nThe robot is as tall as a house and weighs in at approximately 1000 lbs. His arms are made from Mango Chutney barrels and his legs are plastic water drums. Dragun's only metal part is his head, which is a wood burning stove. Dragun is made from 90% post consumer waste; he’s recycled! The robot took final shape in a single instant when Nick found the bright orange mail pallets (chest) and blue water barrels (legs) at the scrappy San Pablo salvage yard in Oakland late in 2011. \r\n\r\nDragun will be on display at Distrikt camp from Monday August 27 through Monday September 3 at 9 o'clock and F, Black Rock desert. You are invited to attend a candle lighting ceremony on Monday August 27th at 9P.M. playa time. Come get a piece of him (plastic) in necklace form at the lighting.",

It will be explained how the Portal’s designs incorporate the geometric evolution of the Earth’s interactive energy body and relate to the human chakra system.\r\n\r\nHarlan Emil Gruber is a large-scale sculptural artist who merges his interests in art, design, and science into a unique body of work. He received a degree in Environmental Design from Parsons School of Design in 1985. His diverse career has included art furniture, sound sculpture, future habitation concepts, and large-scale interactive installations. His work has been exhibited in a variety of settings, from galleries in New York City and New Mexico, to the Black Rock desert in Nevada for the Burning Man festival.

Author Richard Leviton describes etheric “blue dishes” under all sacred sites that collect subtle cosmic energies and distribute them into the earth and atmosphere. For Burning Man 2007 I designed a sky blue dish 61 feet in diameter and 9 1/2 feet high with sky blue carpet to physically manifest this idea while providing an environment of floating in the sky. In the center are three geometric forms that embody Leviton’s concept of an aspect of the Earth’s energy body evolving from its current geometric form to an icosidodecahedron. I built a half dodecahedron that houses the Quasar Wave Transducer sound sculpture that produces low frequency vibrations in the range of brain waves and earth resonance, and a half icosidodecahedron steel frame covered in stainless steel mirror triangles. These two shapes are shaded by a half icosahedron steel frame covered in aluminet shade cloth so that one may experience these shapes both day and night. A 30 foot section facing east was opened during sunrise. The Sapphire Portal acted as a personal, planetary and galactic vibrational alignemnent environment, providing profound experiences for many participants.",

How is the 27-year-old event's skyrocketing mainstream appeal changing burner culture? Can Black Rock City, that temporary desert city, really double in size to 100,000 citizens, as its founder envisions? Or is the future of this culture to be found off the playa, in cities around the world? And who will be calling the shots? \r\nJoin Steven T. Jones – the Bay Guardian city editor and author of The Tribes of Burning Man: How an Experimental City in the Desert is Shaping the New American Counterculture – for a lively discussion of how this culture evolved and where it's headed. As one of the few journalists regularly working the Burning Man beat, he offers an inside yet independent perspective on this country's preeminent countercultural institution and its role in modern American life.",

He is based in San Diego, California and teaches both 5 Rhythms and SheddingSkins workshops throughout the US and in Europe. \r\n\r\nThe SheddingSkins path is a seamless blend of Movement Meditation, Sound Alchemy, Shamanic Ritual and Tantric Ceremony into one cohesive practice where each of these medicines are used to create a comprehensive system of personal transformation. \r\n\r\nwww.sheddingskins.com \r\n\r\nTessabella is a Massage Therapist and spiritual dance practitioner who has found great passion, grounding and healing in movement. Dance is both a therapy and a celebration for her. She loves the magic, power and immensity of the transformation and awakening she experiences in herself and others through movement.",

    "description": "The now infamous camp challenge is back. With origins dating all the way back to the 1980s, this camping tradition has morphed into something truly monstrous. During the heat of the day, in triple digit temperatures, one must eat a helping of five-alarm chili, cooked with the dreaded Guatemalan insanity pepper (grown only by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum). Then, to wash it down, a shot of hot pepper vodka, also infused with the same insanely hot pepper. Now, when you want nothing more than an ice-cold beverage to quench the fire burning in your mouth, you instead must chug a cheap, warm beer that's been sitting out in the sun since daybreak. Why, might you ask, would anyone want to do this? Hell if we know! It's a terrible idea! It's a horrible thing to conceive, much less do on purpose! Yet, as demonstrated by the droves of people who participated AND completed the challenge in 2009 and 2010, we apparently underestimated human nature. Not only did crowds show up for the challenge, but they returned over the course of the week to to share the pain with their friends. And by share, we mean point and laugh while grown men cried and stumbled down the street in a daze. We even had a university anthropologist come hangout, just to observe this odd aspect of human behavior.  We're bringing it back spicier than ever for 2012!",

We will define consensual non-monogamy and differentiate it from other relationship styles. We will share our experiences in the consensual non-monogamy world. Styles of consensual non-monogamy discussed include open relations, swinging, polyamory, polifidelity, and single but non-monogamous. We will discuss how we deal with jealousy, as well as some risks. Most of all we will try to answer whatever questions you may have.",

It is a simple, powerful moving meditation that anyone – of any age, size, or physical ability - can practice. There are no steps to follow, no choreography to learn, no way to do it wrong. The only requirement is a body that is still breathing, a heart that is still beating, and mind that is still curious! \r\n\r\nJust like light, sound or ocean waves, a dancing body when moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion.\r\n\r\nThe 5Rhythms are:\r\n\r\nFLOWING – the fluid, continuous, grounded glide of our own movements\r\n\r\nSTACCATO – the percussive, pulsing beat that shapes us a thousand different ways\r\n\r\nCHAOS – the rhythm of letting go, releasing into the catalytic wildness of our dance that can never be planned or repeated\r\n\r\nLYRICAL – the rhythm of trance, where the weight of self-consciousness dissolves, where we lighten up and disappear into our own uniqueness\r\n\r\nSTILLNESS – the quiet emptiness, where gentle movements rise and fall, start and end, in a field of silence\r\n\r\nPlease join RhythmWave as we return to the Black Rock City for our sixth year with this gorgeous dance/meditation practice that we love to share with you!",

    "description": "\"The quickest way to still the mind is to move the body.\" ~ Gabrielle Roth The 5Rhythms is an in-bodied, out of your mind dance experience not to be missed. It is a simple, powerful moving meditation that anyone – of any age, size, or physical ability - can practice. There are no steps to follow, no choreography to learn, no way to do it wrong. The only requirement is a body that is still breathing, a heart that is still beating, and mind that is still curious! Just like light, sound or ocean waves, a dancing body when moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion.",

Follow the white rabbit on a journey through the mandalic world of cosmic coincidence, open the door to lady serendipity and invite her in for a pot of freshly brewed synchronici-tea.\r\n\r\nTake a stroll into the infinite corridor of chaos and discover the self recursive nature of reality from humans to dark matter. This workshop will unravel the fractal geometry of our universe and allow you to witness the organic structures that grow straight out of the abyss - in the words of Douglas Hofstadter:\r\n\r\n“It turns out that an eerie type of chaos can lurk just behind a facade of order - and yet, deep inside the chaos lurks an even eerier type of order.”\r\n\r\nJust a coincidence? Our lives tend to orchestrate a storyline filled with bizarre synchronicities and connections seemingly beyond explanation, however most are unaware of the extent that our cosmos reflects this characteristic. Ever wondered why the moon and the sun appear to be the same size from Earth? From the atom to the solar system, in this workshop we take a look into the truly unbelievable level of serendipity inherent in our universe.",

    "description": "Nothing new can emerge without first a coming together. Creation - in all of its infinite forms - requires an encounter: of people, of materials, of ideas. Everything was born of relations - of chemistry and community, of labor and love. Every single thing.\r\n\r\nThis simple truth poses important questions: if everything is born from a cauldron of relations — from whence comes the spark? And might not some types of relations prove more an obstacle to creativity than its fertile soup? Answers to these questions could in turn help us to answer perhaps the most important question of all: How can we create a more creative world?\r\n\r\nOn Thursday August 30, 2012, TEDxBlackRockCity seeks to investigate the nature of creativity and possibilities of its fluorescence.\r\n\r\nBlack Rock City — or Burning Man — the largest intentional community on earth, and one of the world’s most vibrantly creative places, will provide an especially powerful setting for this investigation. On its most basic level, TEDxBlackRockCity will provide a stage for some of Burning Man’s most visionary inhabitants to speak about their ideas and their creations. On a deeper level, it will draw on the very values of Burning Man, whose Ten Principles (radical inclusion, gifting, de-commodification, radical, self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation, and immediacy) will provide touchstones for the speakers in their talks.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is in the spirit of three of these Principles: Inclusion, Communality and Participation, that TEDxBlackRockCity aims to be more than merely a staged performance. For it is intended, above all, to foster creativity among all of its remarkable participants — both on stage and off — drawing on the uniquely dynamic community of Burning Man to concoct an exemplar of that fertile soup churning with creative sparks.\r\n\r\nTEDxBlackRockCity will take place on August 30, 2012 at 1PM, located at Play)A(Skool —9:45 & Esplanade.",

    "description": "Nothing new can emerge without first a coming together. Creation - in all of its infinite forms - requires an encounter: of people, of materials, of ideas. Everything was born of relations - of chemistry and community, of labor and love. Every single thing.\r\n\r\nThis simple truth poses important questions: if everything is born from a cauldron of relations — from whence comes the spark? And might not some types of relations prove more an obstacle to creativity than its fertile soup? Answers to these questions could in turn help us to answer perhaps the most important question of all: How can we create a more creative world?\r\n\r\nOn Thursday August 30, 2012, TEDxBlackRockCity seeks to investigate the nature of creativity and possibilities of its fluorescence.\r\n\r\nBlack Rock City — or Burning Man — the largest intentional community on earth, and one of the world’s most vibrantly creative places, will provide an especially powerful setting for this investigation. On its most basic level, TEDxBlackRockCity will provide a stage for some of Burning Man’s most visionary inhabitants to speak about their ideas and their creations. On a deeper level, it will draw on the very values of Burning Man, whose Ten Principles (radical inclusion, gifting, de-commodification, radical, self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation, and immediacy) will provide touchstones for the speakers in their talks.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is in the spirit of three of these Principles: Inclusion, Communality and Participation, that TEDxBlackRockCity aims to be more than merely a staged performance. For it is intended, above all, to foster creativity among all of its remarkable participants — both on stage and off — drawing on the uniquely dynamic community of Burning Man to concoct an exemplar of that fertile soup churning with creative sparks.\r\n\r\nTEDxBlackRockCity will take place on August 30, 2012 at 1PM, located at Play)A(Skool —9:45 & Esplanade.",

This Portable Dance Party roams the night, generating complete awesomeness, street by street and block by block, onto buses and subways, into public fountains and beyond. Inevitably interfacing with the public, together we create an infectious epidemic of fun. A Roaming Party Adventure that lasts all night long!\r\n\r\nAnd the Decentralized Dance Party (DDP) is headed to Burning Man for the first time in 2012.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to throw a massive, Playa-wide DDP and create a Primeval Party Moment more powerful than all which have come before.\r\n\r\nIt’s likely to be a very good time.\r\n\r\nTHE PLAN:\r\nTogether, we will create a free-roaming, Open-Source-themed DDP, powered by over 150 synchronized boomboxes, guerrilla sound systems and art cars that will explore and interact with as many other art structures and theme camps as possible, in a full-throttle adventure that rages all over the Playa, from sunset to sunrise!\r\n\r\nIt will commence on Thursday August 30th, at 7:30, at the feet of the MAN, as the sun is setting and conclude twelve hours later, as the full moon Reaches Its Apex and the sun begins to rise on Friday morning...\r\n\r\nBring your own boombox, or borrow one from the 150 we will be lending out.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL THE DETAILS ON HOW TO PARTICIPATE AND CONTRIBUTE AND ENJOY ARE RIGHT HERE: http://bit.ly/PrnJ7b",

You can discover those places you’ve felt stuck, while you are supported in letting go. You learn to become aware of those times when you get in your own way, and come to see the choices open to you. You embrace what you desire the most, and deeply commit to letting your dreams and your visions be more important than you past wounds. You will find yourself reconnecting with your innate beauty, wholeness and power in each moment.\r\n\r\nHeart of Now workshops include numerous assistants to support you and to create a sacred space for transformation. A deeply nurturing environment is created. This teamwork approach deepens the experience of service and camaraderie, where all are able to experience their vulnerabilities, allowing trust and growth.

Soothe yourself under the 10 powerful misting jets filled with pure Sierra snowmelt, obtained from a 9000 ft mountain spring. After your mist, head over to our adjacent Oasis Lounge and relax in the shade with a glass of wine or water.  When the sun sets, misting ends and the black lights come on, illuminating the beautiful \"River of Time\" mural. The Poi pond comes alive with hula hoopers, poi spinners and light background music.  This will be the Misting Dome's last year on the playa. Stop by and celebrate a great 2012 with us!",

    "description": "We are on a mission for creative and consciousness-awakening ideas for the ‘New World’. The Mayan prophesy states that we are approaching the end of an age in 2012 – this is a time of transition from one World Age into another. The message they give concerns our choice of how we enter the future ahead. How we cross this threshold will determine how we transition into the coming age.The American nation has already seen a taste of what is to come from other nations, with a gradual decline in standards, increased unemployment and the real-estate and industrial collapse. Coinciding with the ending of the Mayan calendar in December 2012, we feel there is an increased public focus on world events which acts as a catalyst for major change.This project documents the progression of the fulfillment of our objective – collecting entries for The New World Manifesto. Contributions to the manifesto will be personally delivered to the ‘Gods of the Elements’ in Chichen Itza on the 21st December 2012.We are bringing the question to you; How do you want to enter this new age? This project is designed so that people from around the world can contribute to the Manifesto. We will be:-Creating an online documentary series, event log and blog of our voyage.-Uploading content daily that you can comment on and participate in.-Searching for contributors for our ‘new world manifesto’.-Interviewing people from a cross-section of American society.-Filming the ‘making-of’ documentary feature film for release in Feb. 2013.The story is narrated by five leading characters - a cabaret performer, a reporter, an actor, a cook and an artist. They will be Accompanied by the 3 crew members, the cinematographers / photographers.In each documentary episode, the interviewees will be asked about their vision of the ‘New World’ and will be offered the opportunity to enter their wishes into The Manifesto. We are all creating our future right now! So let's do it together!",

The Orgasmatron had been a fixture at Burning Man for many years, giving thousands of women extreme physical pleasure in an environment that was very safe, comfortable and private. Two years ago we took everything we had learned and completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and we gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. You may have seen it at Spanky’s Wine Bar. This year we’ve taken it that much further with a singular goal of maximizing our guests’ overall pleasure, along with the comfort and sensuality of the environment. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, and deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience in an environment that is safe, comfortable and private, and which leaves you feeling completely respected and in control. Come solo, or better yet, bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and personal experience. You can wear as much or as little as you would like while riding this marvelous machine, and you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, the Orgasamator Experience at our I-Scream Parlour is something you won't want to miss. Visit us at the Camp for Sensual Pleasures, in Spanky’s Village, and also ask about The Pope’s Massage & Hair washing.",

We need three eligable bachelors (or even more because there's enough of Ninzy to handle Gunga Din's personal hoardes) and come Friday evening before The Wall Street Burn out on the deep playa we will be hosting our show.  Complete with playa-sanctioned pyrotechnics, our 45 minute show will be an eye-popping experience indeed.  Head out beyond the Temple and look for the 21st Century version of The Dating Game set, pull up a chair, and get your curry on.  The winning bachelor and Ninzy will be whisked away in our very own Barbie's Mobile Whorehouse in plush comfort, complete with champagne and minions to act like sycophants to their very beck and call, and escorted to The Wall Street Burn.  Afterwards the lovely couple will come back to Barbie Death Camp to perhaps consumate their date.  Or not.  You never know for sure but one thing is certain:  A splendid time is guaranteed for all.",

Our community started hosting salons in January 2010 as a safe space for the folks of Synchronicity and our friends to share finished or unfinished works of art, poetry, song, or any form of creative release.  The idea was to encourage people in the community to create, share, and hear thoughts or ideas from fellow creative souls.  It has since expanded, and we have enjoyed works of musicians, poets, storytellers, palindromists, historians, novelists, ramblers, gamblers, painters, filmmakers, drunks, fathers, mothers, lovers, dreamers, and psychedelic clowns from all over this land!\r\nA crowd of lovely folks from across the playa will be gathering at 7.30 pm in preparation for the night's event.  A list will be roaming around, with 20 spots to fill. As 8 pm nears, we pile in front of our stage and are greeted by the lovely host of the evening.  From there.. anything goes!",

    "description": "We learn tickling as a form of play and a form of connection. With us you will take it to the next level as a form of sensation play or even a bit of dominance and submission with your partner. Where you take it is up to you. The class is taught by men and women who have been involved in the tickling community for several years.\r\n\r\nIt is best to bring a partner to play with and something comfortable to lay upon. We will provide some basic tickling instruments and a bit of rope if you want to bind your partners wrists during the exercise (optional). If you don't have a partner you may still attend and listen or we might match you up. Due to possible space limitations we may give preference to those with a partner first.\r\n\r\nVolunteers are also welcome for our demos. This is an audience participation so be prepared to laugh, giggle, snort, chortle, etc.\r\n\r\nAlthough tickling is not always in an adult setting due to the nature of the talk and our interaction we ask that all participants and observers be at least 18 years of age. All genders and orientations are welcome to attend and volunteer.\r\n\r\nYou will learn some new techniques to enhance sensual play with other people and we will teach you some ticklish locations you may not have been aware of.\r\n\r\nIf the class is interested we can go into more of a deeper talk about the power exchange aspect of tickling.\r\n\r\nCome visit us and have fun. We'll likely either be in the large dome or under shelter at Otis Spankmore. We will post sign(s) to help direct you to the class.",

It represents our hopes, dreams, memories, life and death and eventually rebirth. The tower will be planned in the UK, and built from scratch in the Black Rock Desert.\r\n\r\nThe bell founding takes place on the Tuesday night, beside the Tower of Nowhere on the Playa. We will cast five bells, a large central one which hangs as the centrepiece and four others encircling this, hung on each support.\r\n\r\nThe bell casting is surrounded by ritual and theatre, with people being invited to gift jewellery (copper, brass, bronze, tin, zinc, gold, silver but not steel, titanium etc) to the molten metal, in order to become a part of the bells themselves. \r\n\r\nImagine the atmosphere filled with chaos and fervour, anticipation and ritual, and a mesmerising display of traditional craftsmanship!\r\n\r\nThe grand finale sees the great reveal, as the crucible is lifted out of the fiery furnace, the blazing phosphorescent bronze liquid and glowing as it is poured into the bell mould.",

Our resident hippies have put weird hippy magic into the wheels... quests ignored may have unknown consequences... ------------------------ Right across from Center Camp at Blackrock Yearbook (Inner Circle and 4:44) Get your photo taken by the Yearbook while you are there!",

Join RhythmWave's Spinnaker (aka Cynthia Kennedy from Olympia Washington) to this 2 hour class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms: flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right. With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy. In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.",

Whythenose.com is dedicated to the act of wearing a clown nose everyday, in order to make people smile.\r\n\r\nIt’s here for YOU…to encourage you with an act of Heroic Uninhibited Innocence.\r\nIt’s really that simple. In a world filled with distractions and distrust, you’d be amazed at how many people have lost a sense of childlike wonder. Or maybe you wouldn’t…\r\n\r\nIn the year since WhyTheNose was launched on the Playa at Rites of Passage, the project has transformed not only me, but it's brought together thousands of people through the photos and videos I've created.\r\n\r\nWearing a clown nose is fun, it’s easy, and it’s free if you already have the nose. YOU CAN COME GRAB ONE AT CENTER CAMP CAFE AND OTHER LOCATIONS ALL WEEK AT BRC...I'm bringing 5000 :)\r\n\r\nWhyTheNose is only here to show you how joyful it is to change someone’s day with a simple, silly act.\r\nTrust me, the nose breaks through barriers and opens doors every time you wear it…give it a try!\r\n\r\nWhen you wear it and you’re waiting with a kind word, a laugh, a validation that you’re NOT crazy, just happy?\r\nMAN, that’s powerful powerful stuff!\r\n\r\nUltimately, one’s attitude, your inner light, your reason raison d’etre that can make a difference in people’s lives and it’s a simple as the nose on your face.\r\n\r\nBe loving and see what happens!\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of the nose is what creates the dissonance and that slight shift in “reality” is very important..it can (gently) jar people enough to open that door, that opportunity in them for opening up and taking a chance, taking a little risk to interact with someone they don’t know..who has on a clown nose!?!\r\n\r\nFind WhyTheNose at Center Camp Cafe all week and if you pick up a Nose, would you please wear it Wednesday? I want YOU to help me spread the joy and beauty and ethos of OUR community with this one act you take take home and use every day :)\r\n\r\nThank's for the love, sfTex",

The first ~WaVe~ Ver. 1 prototype debuted in NYC in Feb 2011 at the Funhaus technology fair with subsequent indoor, outdoor and mobile versions appearing at various art and bass culture events during the spring and summer throughout in the NYC area including the LOST HORIZONS NIGHT MARKET and the FIGMENT NYC 2011 and 2012 art festival on Governor's Island. \r\nIf you have had the TSUNAMI BASS EXPERIENCE, then you know how it LOOKS, SOUNDS, and FEELS... \r\n\r\nThe ~WaVe~ installation is capable of transducing the low end frequencies as low as 5 Hz, provides a sensory enhancement oft described as a \"bassface inducing,\" but more importantly, taps directly into one's kinestetic learning/thinking modality. It is this, when combined with the proper audio and visual ~WaVeS~ for expontential enahancement, that sparks the intuitive, thereby facilitating proper BASS CULTURE APPRECIATION. \r\n\r\nSo come on by and take a dip in the deluge, challenge your perceptions on the Tsunami Bass Experience's ~WaVe~2.0, custom built 'Body~Sonic' dance platforms that will rumble ur rectum and sooth your heart/mind with oh so fine low end frequency via proper BASS!!",

Since popping up the laptop and logging on isn’t an option, we’ll just have ourselves an addiction party instead.\r\n\r\nOpen to all everyone, gamer or not, we’ll have a little gathering Saturday afternoon. Anyone who has completed our daily quests, or just wants to hang out and get their fix is welcome. Our resident mad alchemist has come up with some special brews, and servings of delicious chocolate cake are available to all. If any of our \"Dragonbreath\" chili remains, it’s a great time to polish that off. Hang out, drink some \"kungaloosh\", take down a \"sulfuron slammer\", and swap war stories of \"How I wiped the 40 man raid\".",

Open to all levels.\r\n \r\nAbout Uma\r\n \r\nA life-long belief of \"to know it is to live it\" found Uma at the doorstep of the famed NYC Jivamukti Yoga Studio of Sharon Gannon and David life. 1997's top grad turned teacher-training director, began to cultivate her roots. Saraswati's \"serial chants\" and \"deft sermons\" quickly soared globally as both U.S. and French edition Marie Claire magazines began to pick up on her message.\r\n \r\nAs the foremost Senior Advanced Certified Jivamukti Yoga Teacher, Saraswati mentored hundreds of students. Devotees and apprentices have gone on to open successful yoga studios nationwide.\r\n \r\nSpiritual master, Shree Maa, initiated Uma into the ceremonial rites of puja worship. Her name Nanda Saraswati, The Goddess of Bliss, was then bestowed.\r\n \r\nThrough intense workshops and rehabilitative knowledge, Uma teaches the authentic experience of becoming your Self. In her pocket she carries a toolkit of ancient teachings: knowledge of Sanskrit language, performance of ceremonial worship, kirtan chanting (5-year tour with famed wallah bhagavan das), meditation, bhakti, and karma yoga studies. Over the years, Uma has had a host of long-standing, high profile, private clients.\r\n \r\nUma’s belief that you can't read life, you have to become life; moves you into the depths of your being, so you can peace out. \r\n \r\nWhen she is not teaching yoga in downtown NYC, she is ecstatically chanting the name of God in bliss-filled, rock the house, get up and dance kirtans with Lokah. Their debut album, The Ivy Ceiling, is a groundbreaking work that fuses their hearts, souls and voices in a collage of sound.  The album features the vocal gracings of Sting and a spoken word introduction by Russell Simmons.  Roderick and Anissa Romero of the Seattle underground band, Sky Cries Mary, are featured on backing vocals.",
