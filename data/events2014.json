Learn, practice and be inspired by some of these techniques and step into your role of creating a more harmonious planet, community and intimate relationship. \r\n  Inspirational as well as interactive, this workshop will introduce 9 areas of knowledge that are essential to the process of navigating into rich, satisfying and authentic relationships. I will guide participants in brief energy exercises, practices in presence, clear communication and exploring courageous authenticity as well as as give background of why each area is important and how they all weave together in a beautiful tapestry of deep love. \r\nIncluded and emphasized is a lively and engaging question and answer period.  Participants will walk away with: \r\n1. Tools and techniques that will enliven and improve their relationships.\r\n 2. Inspiration on how to create healthy, fulfilling relationships. \r\n3. A feeling of excitement about the deeper possibilities inherent in relationships.",

The spirituality embedded in religious texts is universal and profound, and has been of great benefit to society, but the undisciplined psychology of human beings leads to its oversimplification and use as a tool to control others. Atheists today are in a unique position to support critical thinking within a religious society that often condemns it.",

HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 2014 3:15 EXPERIMENT:\r\n\r\n    Begin at 3:15 AM on August 1 (or whenever you can join!). Continue each day until August 31.\r\n    You may write any length, style, form, content, voice, rhythm, etc.\r\n    DO NOT EDIT your work. This is raw stuff, baby. That’s part of the experiment. You are welcome to edit, collage, break apart the poems later for whatever purpose you choose, but please SHARE THE RAW STUFF with us on the website after the experiment.\r\n    (Optional) Do not read what you have written until the month is over, except to skim the work to make sure everything is legible.\r\n    TIP: do not use a felt tip pen unless you don’t care about ink stains on your bed. Many a poet has fallen asleep in the middle of writing.\r\n    If you can help it, don’t even get out of bed! The point is to ride that dream state, that precarious point between sleeping and waking and sleeping.\r\n\r\nThen come by our camp to share your writing! Read on the Big TV Set or in the Dome of the Space Wanderer. \r\n\r\nIf you're up at 3:15am, stop by our camp, be inspired by the otherworldly artwork, and write!",

(screamed loudly with a typical Texas drawl to express joy or exuberance) promises to be the most interactive and entertaining see-saw you've ever experienced.\r\n\r\nAt 33' long x 28' tall, this perfectly balanced see-saw includes an adult playground comprised of a dance platform, pole and jungle gym. A center pole rises through the dance platform and moves with the Yee-Saw. Dancers can use this to radically express themselves while also controlling the riders' experience. Scale the triangular truss to operate from the top of the pole and for a great view of the playa.\r\n\r\nThis year, the machine has successfully entertained the nearly 3,000 member strong Burning Flipside community. It’s now eagerly waiting to play with all of you beautiful people.\r\n\r\nSeatbelts ON!\r\nIt’s Yee-Saw Time!",

As per usual in this sort of event, our highly esteemed panel of untrained professionals will judge upon such features as glossiness of pelt, lack of nits, creativity, fullness of body, amount of previous dinner ensconced within and other equally tangible parameters that attest to the care and feeding of your personal face troll. Bribery and foolishness are considered de rigueur. All that is necessary is that you have some form of facial hair, a good and jolly spirit, and the necessary accoutrement of a cummerbund.

A curated group of art projects will be visited and discussed. This tour will begin at 10:00 AM and run approximately 60-90 minutes, weather permitting. The tours are flexible so feel free to join us on playa if you see a bunch of bikes traveling in a pack, or drop out if you want. The tour starts promptly at the bike racks across from the ARTery (on the Esplanade). Note that there are also ART TOUR - Guided Tour (search Playa Events), and self guided tours (paper copies) available at the ARTery. Most of the art on the playa is self-funded, so be sure to check out your favorite art projects on the Burning Man website now, and then help fund them or volunteer through their respective websites. It takes every single one of us to make Burning Man happen...",

This experience will provide an individual strength and clarity when approaching any difficult situation or life choice. You will learn how to heal disharmony in yourself and others.

    "description": "Mashup Mania is a game show where two players are competing to see who can recognize the most elements of a mashup or cover song. In the case of a cover song, for example, they could name the original band and song name, and the band currently doing the cover.  For a mashup, they could name the different performers, and the different songs, depending on how many songs are being mashed up.  Each correct answer gets 1 point for whoever rings on first, but if they miss any question, the other player gets to hear 10 more seconds and has the opportunity to answer, and gets TWO points for each answer.  This is so that players don't just rush to buzz in if they recognize only one component.  First one to 10 with at least two points more than their opponent wins (kind of like volleyball scoring).  Depending on how many players, we would have an elimination tournament.",

The artist will be taking more photographs of Burners at the opening, some of which may become oil paintings... Will YOU be the next subject? Wine served.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Black Rock Portrait Project? It is a series of oil paintings of the “Children of the Dust”, the people of the Burning Man community. The people at the event are very unique, not just in their commonly outrageous dress (or undress) but their countenance, their demeanor, is unique to the event. Covered in dust these people have a spirit, a freedom unseen back in the “default” world. Because it is the people that create the event, it is my intention to focus on the individual. The “models” are photographed on-site, (with their written permission) and the paintings are created using these photographs  as a reference following the event. These paintings will eventually be shown in a gallery setting hopefully one which will travel the country. A book about the project is also in the works.",

In our classes, you’ll learn how to do these two social partner dances, how to connect with the music and your partner, how to relax, you’ll get to meet and interact with your playa brethren, and you’ll dance a bunch. During the guided practice time, you’ll have a chance to practice during the day and ask questions of the experienced dancers hanging out.

Did you forget to bring a crucial sun-blocking head piece?  Or do you need to collect something through your travels to add to your Playa wardrobe?  Either way, we can help you pick out the perfect complement for your Playa attire, and add a custom chin strap so that your new chapeau doesn't fly away in the Playa wind to become trash fence MOOP.  Then, with your permission, we'll take a lovely photo of you sporting your fashion goodness.  Photos can be accessed later online.  And don't worry--we never post anything without asking permission first.\r\n\r\nAlso:  Do you need hemp rope for those on-Playa bondage classes?  Or to tie up (or tie down), that special Playa someone?  We have lots to give away...and we'll teach you a knot or two while we're at it.  Ask very nicely, and we may give you a suspension bondage ride, or grant you a trip to the view tower to watch the sunset.  Take a tour of our alternative energy usage and grey water recycling.  And don’t forget to pick up one of Camp Conduit’s free bumper stickers.",

Mixing and matching every musical genre, era, and style into one big dance party, it's the soundtrack for the A.D.D. generation -- with free mashup CDs given away like candy! Launched in 2003 in San Francisco, Bootie was the first club night dedicated solely to the burgeoning artform of the bootleg mashup, and is now the biggest mashup event in the world, with regular parties in several cities on four continents. Bootie BRC is presented in part by the BRC Weekly, Black Rock City's independent newsweekly. Bootie ... because one song at a time just isn't enough.",

So prove it. \r\n\r\nCome on down to Camp Nimby in the BC Village at 2pm on Wednesday to join us in resurrecting this old-timey fair game  Black Rock City style. \r\n\r\nFunky beats will help move your feets as you jockey for position on one of the numbered place-mats (think musical chairs). Numbers will be drawn and if you find yourself on the winning place-mat, you win! Piece of cake! \r\n\r\nThere will be many chances to win but a cake-thirsty attitude is strongly recommended. No one said this would be a cake walk! (wait...)\r\n\r\nWe can't wait to see you pastry fiends converge on our humble camp.  This event will literally take the cake!",

Move through the energies of groundedness, sexuality, energy regulation, open hearted love, creative expression, pattern recognition, and divine connection. In this workshop, you will learn how to use the moves and practice principles of Hoop Dance to bring your life into alignment at each chakra level so you feel more balanced and happier.

At Circus Boot Camp, we'll teach you to juggle, unicycle, hoop, slack line, trapeze, crack a whip and indulge your childish fancy in other circus-inspired arts. I know what you're thinking: \"Sure, you'll teach me to juggle... after I've spent years on the road washing elephants and dodging monkey poop!\" Wrong! Our goal is nothing less than to bring the joys of object manipulation, unicycling and other circus arts to the Playa masses in a casual, friendly and fully clothed environment (ok, mostly-clothed). Already a circus pro? Come test your mettle on our slackline; dance your clown shoes through the obstacles of irony; pass clubs with seasoned semi-professionals; try your hand at the Valley of One-Wheeled Doom!!",

    "description": "Join us for a guided creative visualization meditation. We will help you picture the perfect day 10 yrs in your future. The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality.\r\n\r\nYou don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to it.  The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. \r\n\r\nHow? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory \"hooks\" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel \"right\". \r\n\r\nWe will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process.  After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to sharing your future day together.\r\n\r\nDr.Feelgood",

It is an adventurous way of life--physically, emotionally and mentally that citizens of BRC embrace. Our shows are an opportunity for Dark Sparklers and other BRC citizens to explore and showcase their Dark Sparkle through performance, storytelling, and tease.

There will be live visual projection of the sun from solar telescope by astrophysicist Matt O'Dowd. Any art cars with sound systems and FM radio receivers are welcomed to participate our additional immersive simulcast soundscape experience. There will be a small numbers of radio receivers available to be borrowed at the event. The concert starts at the first ray of light on friday morning (August 29, 6am).

    "description": "Experiencing sunrises on the playa is beyond words can describe. While we can’t escape the loud dance music in the morning, NYC director/composer Charlie Dayburn composed a 7-track Original cinematic soundtrack to accompany dayburners like us who are seeking solitude at the dawn of the day. The 7 tracks express 7 roller coaster feelings throughout the week. Charlie Dayburn would like to share the whole album with fellow dayburners through 7 different connection exercises from body contact to soul gazing. This album is also tuned to 432Hz which believes it's the vibrational frequency of our human bodies. It's an more inward experience that is felt inside the body at the spine and heart. Each attendee will receive a copy of the album.",

This is your experience and I try to make it a lasting memory of your time here.\r\nIndividuals, groups, families (in all permutations) are welcome.\r\nI usually begin in the mid to late morning and continue photographing till the late night.  Or until I can no longer stand and photograph.\r\nSo come early in the week, bring your friends and enjoy the rather unique experience of really being photographed.

[freespace]   The experiment started in June of 2013 and has quickly spread to cities around the world. A [freespace] is a gathering place for people to come together, to create, teach, learn, and share the things which they are truly passionate about, and strengthen connections between individuals and communities through art, events, and long term projects. Anything goes as long as it is both free and inclusive like an urban version of the “permission engine” on the playa. Currently there are 8 open [freespaces] in 6 cities on 4 continents. There are communities developing in 26 locations and 18 different countries around the world. [freespace] co-founders and organizers from around the world will host an information session, discussing the [freespace] model and facilitating Q&A.

All exercises are optional and designed to have you feel safe and empowered. This workshop is open to singles and couples, folks of all genders and sexual orientations welcome. \r\n\r\nThis workshop is designed and led by Ali Fogarty, a doctoral candidate in Sociology at Stanford University specializing in sex, gender, and sexuality.

With Guided mediations we learn how to use voice and story to guide the body and mind into complete relaxation. When we're on the playa there are so many things going through our heads and we need to quiet the mind and feel grounded to start the day and eventually focus on our intentions while out in the desert.\r\n\r\nIn Individual guided meditation with Bobby Hedglin Taylor everyone will learn how to follow a guided meditation and experience relaxation on a deep subconscious level to shake off the every day cares and woes! You'll leave with the tools to create your own meditations and those used in class will be gifted to you to use back in the muggle world via youtube. :) You're also welcome to record the meditations we use in class to use again and again!\r\n\r\nI can't promise enlightenment or nirvana, but I can promise a great, peaceful hour on the playa and take you to another world of deep relaxation!\r\n\r\nNamaste\r\n\r\nBobby Hedglin Taylor\r\n\r\nSee also https://www.facebook.com/events/781521991887385/?ref=4#",

    "description": "In Search of the Truth (The Truth Booth)\r\nis an installation comprised of a touring, portable, inflatable ‘Truth Booth’ that embarked on a world tour at the Galway Arts Festival, Ireland in 2011 . The exterior is iconically shaped like a giant cartoon speech bubble with the word ‘TRUTH’ printed on the side. The interior acts much like a photo booth, but serves to compile 2 minute long video responses from the public. Once seated inside people are invited to record their opinions and thoughts as they finish the statement: “The truth is...”. \r\n\r\nThroughout this long-term project the video footage will be compiled and edited into a video installation. To expand and engage with audiences, the movements of The Truth Booth and sample responses will also be tracked, edited, and categorised on a dedicated website. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to try to capture as many definitions, confessions and thoughts on The Truth as possible, creating a diverse ‘portrait’ of people across the globe. \r\n\r\nThe Cause Collective is a team of artists, designers and ethnographers creating innovative art in the public realm. Their projects explore and enliven public spaces by creating a dynamic conversation between issues, sites and the public audience. By exploring ideas that affect and shape society, they seek to add the ‘public’ back into public space and art.",

We will cover stalls, lasso’s and body breaks. Lastly, we will integrate everything we’ve learned into a magical wand dance where you will captivate others with your ability to magically float a levi wand! This will be a short string workshop.

Are you clear on what these terms really mean?  Susan Cain has written a fantastic book called Quiet:The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking.  Her Ted Talk has been viewed over 9,000,000 times!  Susan maintains that our society is set up to favor and promote extroverts. Yet it’s estimated that over a third of us are introverts.  Introverts sometimes feel devalued and not aware of the unique gifts they have to share with all of us. Through a combination of lecture, group discussion, and experiential activity, you will learn how introversion and extroversion are defined.  You will learn how being an introvert can impact on your family and work life.  You will learn how to become more sensitive to the needs of both introverts and extroverts. You will learn how to find out more about introverts and extroverts.",

The Empire State Building and 25ft King Kong loom above the NYC skyline while a runway show that blows fashion week out of the dust goes on street level starring you. As a premiere daytime destination, Kostume Kult will be providing costume transformations to the under-accessorized masses of BRC. No person shall go uncostumed or unfabulous because we have a full team of costume stylists ready to dress you up and help you transform. The only thing we ask of you is a proud strut down our runway to display your new duds to booty moving music. If you prefer a DIY approach, step inside our Krafting Dome where you can gain the supplies and know-how to upgrade your bike and your look. Our professional staff knows their way around a glue gun and we're not afraid to bedazzle YOU! The playa provides the grit, we supply the glamour so hop the K Train to costume transformations, music and a non stop runway show that would make RuPaul blush. Of course the city never sleeps and our amazing DJ line up keeps us moving into the night as the city lights shine bright into the dark playa night. Also not to be missed is the Peepshow FreaKKshow, BRC's only 24 hour participatory peep show where you can be the star or simply sneak a peek at some Big Apples! Down our alleys you will find costumes, crafting, sparkle pony vagrants, playa hustlers, burner working gals and street wise tramps. You won't want to miss it so jump the turnstile to the KKrossroads Of The World. After all if you can make it here you can make it anywhere!",

We’re all looking for ways to have experiences that really rock our world and awaken our senses!\r\n\r\nHere’s your chance to experience something I guarantee you’ve never felt before!\r\nEros Tangeré is a one-on-one “tactile performance” that can only be described as a sensation experience that is created as your very body is played as if it were an ever changing organic musical instrument.  Your body becomes the surface upon which amazing erotic sensations will cascade with the undulations of an amazing music track and scent. Imagine that you can FEEL the expression of music with your body. Shed of your clothes, you lay prone and robbed of your sense of sight, our artists perform upon your body with the music in ways that you have never experienced. Pleasing aromas will further enhance your experience of this unique and creative custom designed sensory performance. Not for the faint of heart. This is a one on one, sensual adult event. Space is very limited so signing up for a session prior to start time is highly recommended. Check at The Amazing Illumelodie Dome inside Silicon Village for more info and added times.",

Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through group laughter. It’s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. “Inappropriate” Laughter Yoga is also a possibility, if our clientele are okay with it. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits.

Whether you're a couple or alone, there's always room for everyone to learn the basics and show of some new moves in the playa or in the default world. \r\nFacilitated by: E aka #DanceNinja at Camp Awesomeness",

It is a spiritual endeavor for us. We fully respect and love the people we help because at HG, we all work on ourselves on a consistent basis as well. We think that those who are willing to dig deep and look at themselves honestly are the most courageous people in the world, not to mention, people we’d want to hang with.

    "description": "Given the Mystery of the physical world explored through science, we need a corresponding spirituality that incorporates the profound insights of science, while including the Mystery of subjectivity found in spirituality and religion.\r\n-\tI propose that Cosmic Personification as a transformational identity shift that includes in Mystery, objective and subjective, and initiates and sustains conscious evolution in our lives. This shift brings the capacity for continuing our personal and social transformation.\r\n-\tI propose living fully human as the cosmos personifying as a viable spiritual meta-orientation. This would mean we intellectually, emotionally, perceptually recognize ourselves as the totality and as unique expressions of Universe. We are not separate from the Universe or each other, rather we are the Whole uniquely manifesting as these dynamic human forms. From this recognition, we shift our behavior individually and collectively to align with this deep insight into our identity. The workshop will introduce this framework and guide participants to practice, awaken, and sustain their unique cosmic embodiment for the sake of the Whole.",

Come for an early hour of low impact exercise in the Longevity Stick Art (LSA) discipline of 12 low-impact exercises to build balance, flexibility, strength, mental focus, breathing capacity, and vitality, and open your points and channels. Bring your water or hydration liquid. We’ll have sticks available for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed the Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese Army. He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain their health through LSA, and vowed that if he was ever freed, he would dedicate his life to spreading its benefits to the world, with the proviso that no future trainer could ever charge for the course. (Sounds like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, settled in Southern California, and started teaching classes of students and future teachers. Today, there are dozens of classes weekly around So Cal. Also, LSA is spreading around the US and world. Many more details are available at: www.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html and www.filmbaby.com/films/2341 Master Dao passed away late 2010 at age 89, and one of our camp was privileged to attend his funeral, and his last birthday party, a few months before.",

    "description": "Debris is an interactive, collaborative installation which is being created as a response to the problems presented by single use plastic.\r\n\r\nThe work reflects the literal problem of plastic in marine environments while offering a symbolic representation of the chemical body burdens carried by wildlife and humans alike. In presenting these issues, we are asked to consider misplaced notions of “disposability”, calling in to question consumer driven waste which has devalued what is in fact a very important material.\r\n\r\nParticipate: Make a Fish\r\n\r\nExplore the Marine Food Web by drawing or painting a marine creature. A large array of fish, crustaceans, birds and mammals all make up the web and are all affected by chemical body burdens represented here by plastic. Think of how you can incorporate re-purposed material into your creature. This way, we can make use of that which is normally disposed of without second thought.\r\n\r\nSend a .jpg of your piece to gallery420@gmail.com.\r\nIn doing so, you will be releasing your creature into the “ocean”.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe images are transferred onto repurposed materials like foamcore and are used as the base of interactive installations.These installations are set up in educational institutions and gallery exhibitions. Through the installation, people may learn about how we contribute directly to this problem, even if we live inland, and how we are directly impacted through the chemical body burdens we carry. Participants are introduced to solutions on how to reduce exposure to chemicals in their own lives and how to lessen the environmental impacts from the source.\r\nSimilar to the processing of material in the actual ocean, images will be replicated, transferred, redistributed, distressed, and reworked as the instillation is plugged into educational programming and handled by participants. \r\n\r\nhttp://virtualvoices.org/plastic",

Grounding is a vital component of daily balanced living. It allows us to deepen our connection with mother earth, or Gaia, and source energy. It teaches us how to release stress, stay focused, clear the chatter from our minds and auric fields, and eliminate free radicals from our bodies. When we connect with Gaia, we begin to realize that we are all safe and well provided for. We learn to understand our greater truths and to let go of fear, anger, guilt and anxiety. This allows us to establish a connection with our divine authentic self. Whether you are a seasoned meditator or novice, you are invited to experience an ancient Eastern meditation breathing technique that has been passed on from master to master for centuries to achieve self-enlightenment. In this workshop you will learn about the chakra system, with an emphasis on the root, sacral and solar plexus. Our chakras govern our life force energy as well as our glandular, mental and emotional systems. Through the use of sage, crystals and sound we will also start to understand basic cleansing of our auric field and our surroundings. We will utilize ancient grounding techniques and a guided meditation to establish our connection with Gaia, help transform our outlook, and feel more grounded in our everyday lives.",

But at the Black Rock City Museum of Transportation History, we explore the fictional story of fictional transportation in a fictional historical Black Rock City. Learn about how burners got around the Playa before bikes ruled and art cars amazed. See pictures, models, and artifacts gathered since Black Rock City's fictional founding nearly 150 years ago. Hear from a guide, or if we're not around, take a self-guided tour. Perhaps most importantly, tell us your own stories, or perhaps your grandmother's, about BRC's fictional transportation past!\r\n\r\nWe'll be open during the day (lunchtime to dinnertime) starting on Monday.\r\n\r\nOur Burner \"Black Tie\" Gala takes place on Wednesday night at 9PM. Fancy wine, cheese, and more! Come find us on 9:00 near Isfahan behind the museum.",

Some of those tools are especially applicable when working with Ayahuasca. She will share some useful tools that can maximize our experience, as well as what we can learn, in those inner voyages. Non- ordinary states of consciousness can come with their own sets of 'superpowers', operating principles and potential pitfalls. Knowing how to use those forces for expansion, and alignment, can not only occasionally save you from 'the inner gates of hell', but also bring accelerated growth, ecstatic experiences, and a deep feeling of connectedness with yourself, others, and the world.",

A hug that evolves into a spiral that is so safe and supported that we enter graceful states of consciousness. \tIf you are looking for ways to enhance your relationship with your partner, this may be useful. Relating in non-verbal, non-linear fashion can have an effect of breaking through barriers of relating on new and different levels.

You will leave feeling refreshed and respected.  Come solo, or better yet, bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience.  You can wear as much or as little as you would like while riding this marvelous machine, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense, and no penetration is involved.

The Orgasmatron had been a fixture at Burning Man for many years, giving thousands of women exceptional physical pleasure in an environment that was safe, comfortable, sensual and private.  Four years ago we took everything we had learned from it, completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and we gave it a new name: The Orgasamator.  Development has continued with a singular goal of maximizing sensuality, along with our guests’ overall pleasure and comfort.  When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience.  You will leave feeling refreshed and respected.  Come solo, or better yet, bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience.  You can wear as much or as little as you would like while riding this marvelous machine, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense, and no penetration is involved. If you are a woman, the Orgasamator Experience at our I-Scream Parlour is something you won't want to miss.

At last, a retreat where the aural options are in keeping with the indigenous stillness and aesthetics of the Black Rock Desert. It will provide shade and shelter to weary travelers who might require a bit of tranquility and quiet in order to recharge and allow them to commune with their internal and external environments. The Otic Way is an arc of individual Satellites with a central Shade area, composed of geometric crystalline clusters of interwoven modules, that provide individualized and group spaces for meditation and contemplation of the sunrise, sunset and our natural surroundings. The biomimicry of the design complements the desert backdrop and offers a manmade structure that takes inspiration from the rocks, mountains, caves, and plateaus found in nature. It is made completely of interlocking wood, with no nails or metal fasteners.",

There, Terence McKenna, Jonathan Ott, Ann & Sasha Shulgin, and a host of other psychedelic luminaries passed along many insights, discoveries, and wild tales to the fortunate Tribe members who were there. And it was at the end of the pool where Terence McKenna gave some of his last talks at the Chan Kah.\r\n\r\nYears later, then in 2003, a few alumni from those conferences decided to have a \"Palenque reunion\" at the Burning Man Festival, and so they organized a lecture series to continue the Palenque tradition.",

We will also have activities scheduled for fun at the bar, check out our schedule when you come by. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day.

What will your inner peepshow performer do?\r\n\r\nKostume Kult recreates the glory days of NYC circa the 1970's by transporting you to the seedy throwback replica of \"Times Square BRC\". The Empire State Building and 25ft King Kong loom above the NYC skyline while a runway show that blows fashion week out of the dust goes on street level starring you. As a premiere daytime destination, Kostume Kult will be providing costume transformations to the under-accessorized masses of BRC. No person shall go uncostumed or unfabulous because we have a full team of costume stylists ready to dress you up and help you transform. The only thing we ask of you is a proud strut down our runway to display your new duds to booty moving music. If you prefer a DIY approach, step inside our Krafting Dome where you can gain the supplies and know-how to upgrade your bike and your look. Our professional staff knows their way around a glue gun and we're not afraid to bedazzle YOU! The playa provides the grit, we supply the glamour so hop the K Train to costume transformations, music and a non stop runway show that would make RuPaul blush. Of course the city never sleeps and our amazing DJ line up keeps us moving into the night as the city lights shine bright into the dark playa night. Also not to be missed is the Peepshow FreaKKshow, BRC's only 24 hour participatory peep show where you can be the star or simply sneak a peek at some Big Apples! Down our alleys you will find costumes, crafting, sparkle pony vagrants, playa hustlers, burner working gals and street wise tramps. You won't want to miss it so jump the turnstile to the KKrossroads Of The World. After all if you can make it here you can make it anywhere!",

If you are convicted or found liable, you can accept her sentence, which is guaranteed to be interesting or you can try your luck at the wheel of punishment.  Or you may win your case and see your opponent subjected to Playa justice.  Either way, someone always pays!  Whatever the choice or the outcome, you can be assured of an unbalanced hearing…for the Playa, that is.\r\n \r\nBring your case!  You will be heard!  Is it your noisy neighbor?  A spat with a girlfriend?  Did a campmate drink your last cold beer?  Maybe it was just your turn to drive the art car.  Whatever the dispute, our jurist will sort it out.\r\n\r\nWe will hold court twice during the week or if an emergency arises.

There is much wisdom in the poly community which can be helpful to people trying to make *any* relationship work, monogamous or Polyamorous. There will be a facilitated discussion in which you can get your questions addressed and some of the knowledge in our community can be shared.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to cool off and de-dust yourself after our tea party, bring a water donation to enjoy PolyParadise's famous Human Carcass Wash.",

    "description": "For the past several hundred years, Western society as a whole has been primarily influenced by the dogma that matter is as that is actually \"real,\" and that the best way to understand reality is to approach it like a machine, seeing how its parts function. This approach, while making possible the unprecedented technological advances that began during the industrial revolution, have likewise led us to an unprecedented state of emergency - primarily seen in the ecological crisis. To remedy the alienation and disenchantment that this still dominant paradigm has propagated, we must recover those dimensions of the cosmos and of our own being that can't be found or explained in material terms. Opening our \"archetypal eyes,\" as depth psychologist James Hillman put it, can help us to once again move in rhythm with the threads of meaning that weave through our lives and the cosmos as a whole.",

The participant  will be asked to where headphones playing ambient tones and soundscapes for the duration of session to also experience the healing of sound combined with Reiki.  Sessions can be given in 15 minutes to 1 hour depending on the participants needs.  Our Reiki healer will sit down with each participant for a short conversation before the session to allow them to connect and become absolutely comfortable with one another.  Reiki is joint practice between healer and participant.  The more open and accepting of the universal healing energy you are, the more powerful your session will be for both yourself and the healer.

For one week, we step outside of our usual selves, finding God in a phone booth, discovering your true authentic self in the eyes of clown on whip-its, or stumbling upon the Barbie Death Camp and Wine Bistro.\r\n\r\nBut, all this novelty can be a strain on your relationship. Once you combine it with the heat, dehydration, strange substances, strange food and even stranger campmates, your previously lovely and wonderful partner may seem to have turned into some sort of dusty alien. A dusty alien you can barely stand.\r\n\r\nFortunately, you can avoid a visit to the Costco Soulmate Trading Outlet with a bit of preparation and foresight. In this workshop, led by open relationship coach and multiple-Burn veteran Marcia Baczynski, you’ll find out everything you need for your relationship to not only survive, but thrive, at Burning Man. We’ll cover:\r\n\r\nYour #1 secret weapon for avoiding fights on the playa (especially those really, really stupid ones)\r\n- The real reason the Burn makes or breaks relationships\r\n- What to do when you have different ideas of what “fun at Burning Man” means\r\n- A quick and easy way to get the most out of your time together -- and apart\r\n- Simple and practical steps you can take now to make your Burn together the best one ever\r\n\r\nPlus, you’ll walk out with your own personalized guide for staying connected, getting what you both need and having a blast during your time in the dust.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re a virgin burner or going home yet again, join us for a hilarious and practical workshop that will help you make sure you get to enjoy your camp, your costumes and your favorite co-conspirators.\r\n\r\nBecause “going to the Burn” shouldn’t mean “sitting in a hot tent processing.”",

    "description": "Let’s imagine if we had a whole different art and culture. Come on, enough of this “bitches and ho’s” and SWAT teams kicking down doors. Enough of this “get low” bullshit. And how come it’s always the womenthat have to get low? We already have a situation where the masses of women and the masses of people are pushed down and held down lowenough already. It’s time for us to get up and get on up.Imagine if we had a society where there was culture—yes it was lively and full of creativity and energy and yes rhythm and excitement, but at the same time, instead of degrading people,lifted us up. Imagine if it gave us a vision and a reality of what it means to make a whole different society and a whole differentkind of world. Imagine if it laid out the problems for people in making this kind of world and challenged them to take upthese problems. Imagine if art and culture too—movies, songs, television, everything—challenged people to think critically, tolook at things differently, to see things in a different light, but all pointing toward how can we make a better world.Imagine if the people who created art and culture were not just a handful of people but all of the masses of people, withall their creative energy unleashed, and the time were made for them to do that, and for them to join with people whoare more full-time workers and creators in the realm of art and culture to bring forward something new that wouldchallenge people, that would make them think in different ways, that would make them be able to see things criticallyand from a different angle, and would help them to be uplifted and help them to see their unity with each otherand with people throughout the world in putting an end to all the horrors that we’re taught are just the naturalorder of things.

    "description": "\"What is Rootism?\" My response to this in short: Rootism is a belief that the truth of our learned existence lies in the Roots of all teachings/truths and beliefs. These truths are different for everyone based on how they we raised and what we resonate with at the time of our learning. As a Rootist, we take the roots of various truths and incorporate them into our own mantra, our own way of living, to become the well rounded person that we wish to be. When you resonate with more than one truth, you are a Rootist. There are many different types of Rootist's. You could be a Christian Rootist, a Buddhist Rootist, or any type of Rootist. The moment you resonate with more than one truth & take the roots of those teachings as your truths, you become a Rootist.\r\n\r\nRootism is a lesson that I have learned and come to resonate with over the last few years. I am grateful to share this information with each of you. Please feel free to share this with anyone with whom you feel might be interested.\r\n\r\nAs an offset of Rootism, we have The Rootist's Way. A style of yoga that is in-tentful in it's design and sequences to help to facilitate a certain type of energy clearing and calling in of new energies.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this and for wanting to know more about Rootism.\r\n\r\nThe 8 Principles of Rootism:\r\n\r\n∞Principles of Rootism™\r\n\r\n1. Release what no longer serves - nurture yourself & ground yourself\r\n2. Embrace a Creative Vision\r\n3. Move forward on your journey -Take Steps Fearlessly\r\n4. Empathize and Feel what is going on within you & others\r\n5. Motivate yourself & others by Truth – Check the Ecology of the Whole\r\n6. Bridge the Mind & the Heart\r\n7. Evolve a Pro-Sociality Lifestyle & Manifest a Greater Humanity - help others and give back\r\n8. Revolutionize - Reveal Yourself! Open UP! Inner Knowing is Outer Showing\r\n\r\nThe acronym is \"Remember\"",

Artists such as Phidias and Da Vinci incorporated this sacred geometry into their works, believing it to create an aesthetically pleasing balance. Come to the Mycodelic Forest and learn a little more about sacred geometry and different ways to add it into your art while painting some works of your own. We’ve got acrylic paint, brushes and several sheets of heavy artist’s paper for you. (You might want to bring a hard, flat surface to work on, if you have one).",

We remain disconnected from these forces!\r\n\r\nWe desire to capture those moments of extacy, those moments where the divine enraptures us and our central light explodes and penetrates through us, releasing the forces of the mind and the controlling locks held in the muscles of our bodies.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will incorporate Feldenkrais techniques focused on opening up our 2nd and 4th chakras and reconnecting to our bodies, as well as group and partner interaction and discussions.",

When the time is right ten lucky volunteer enslavees will be marched up to the cat walk and be auctioned off. But this is no ordinary auction. In this one, the merchandise is king and can pick and choose among the myriad offers of the crowd below. Bids can be a ride in an art car, foot massage or perhaps the best martini on the playa. When a suitable exchange has been agreed upon the slightly deranged Auctioneer hammers the bid to a close and Slaver and Slavee go off on a one-hour adventure that is mutually enjoyable for both.

Fitting in with his year's Art Theme \"Caravansary\" and our own kitschy aesthetic we decided if you take kitschy and vaguely middle eastern you get ... why the silly 60s sitcom \"I Dream of Jeannie\" so we've recreated the inside of Jeannie's bottle as this year's \"roadside attraction\".   Other attractions include our resident Mad Scientist's Mutant Animal Zoo and clothes closet.  Times are approximate ... we'll have the stand open from when we wake up till we get tired.  We also appreciate gifts of bags of ice. (Must be unopened) And as always, if you show your junk, you get to cut to the front (of the snow cone queue).",

I could hold my hand out and see a clear shadow on the cracked and fizzured playa, from the stars alone.\"\r\n\r\nOur art project for Burning Man 2014 will be to enlist the active cooperation of approximately 68 thousand other burners as \"co-artists\" with Creation to turn every non-essential light in the city OFF for two hours on the night of Wednesday, August 27th from 11pm to 1am on the 28th.\r\n\r\nThen, everyone can look up and share with me the wonder of our sky there at Black Rock City which most have never seen.

This workshop will explore what words we use to identify, where those words come from, how words impact us, how words can both hurt us and heal us. This is designed to be a workshop for people of all backgrounds. This workshop will be a safe space for people from all perspectives on these words and all identities to explore these words and the impact they have on us. This will be a time for people to share stories of hurt and sorrow, liberation and joy and to be seen and honored in these stories. The same word that hurts one, might heal another. In this space we request open hearts and minds as we dialogue about this sensitive topic of identity, oppression, reclaiming words, creating words, and living into what these words mean. All genders, races, classes, identities, bodies are welcome and honored always.",

During the guided practice time, you’ll have a chance to practice during the day and ask questions of the experienced dancers hanging out. At happy hour, grab a cup of tea, dance and chill and watch the dome light up. Listen to live music if we have a drop-in musician (or let us know if you you’d like to play some blues or tango music at our camp). And then in the evening, dress up, and come dance the night away.

    "event_id": 13059,
    "description": "The workshop is an ultra-condensed form of a type of massage developed by the Body Electric School. It combines breathwork and a sequence of erotic massage techniques which stimulate erotic energy but don’t expend it in ejaculation. The result is often a heightened erotic state some people call a “full body orgasm.\"\r\nIn the Body Electric workshops, these techniques are learned over a two-day weekend workshop which explores intimacy, eroticism, and personal growth.  Here, we’ve got two hours. So, we learn a shortened version just of the massage part, and change the rules a little bit: partners just work on one another, and the massage is a bit shorter. However, as past participants can tell you (and hopefully will in the comments!), the workshops are incredibly powerful, hot (in all senses of the word…), and, for some, deeply healing and transformative. A lot of guys who have done the Burning Man workshop have gone on to do Body Electric, and integrated these new forms of eroticism into their own lives.\r\nA few guiding principles if you’re thinking of coming to the workshop:\r\n- This is a hands-on, clothes-off workshop.  Spectators are not allowed.  You will have an opportunity to opt-out before the massage begins.\r\n- We will be doing one round of massage, so each person will either give or receive.  Note that giving can often be more powerful than receiving.\r\n- Givers of massage may be of any sex and gender.  We’ll be teaching the massage techniques for male bodies (i.e. people with penises).  However, the main part of the practice is not the massage but the energy and breathwork, so female-bodied people are more than welcome to participate!\r\n- Bring a towel and water\r\n- Pee ahead of time\r\n- Bring purell.  We provide massage lotion",

The fundamental qualities of this city in the desert – the world’s largest intentional community – are freedom, experimentation, and participation, precisely the conditions in which new approaches to old (and emerging) problems can be conceived and realized.For most people who come each year to Burning Man, the shared dream is to take the values and aspirations of the Playa back to their homes, workplaces, and communities; to practice and promote the Ten Principles, not just on the playa once a year but all the time everywhere. Transforming the ‘real’ world is a formidable challenge and a powerful dream. \r\n\r\nJoin us at TEDxBlackRockCity as we share the dream and encourage responsibility for making change happen.",

And what skillful language and methods have we found to share these sacred, genuine, crucial, crazy things - creating allies rather than alienating, growing solidarity across the shifts? Joshua Halpern, MA is a transformation ecologist, an artist-activist-educator, and an edge jester. Josh will co-creatively guide us through a body/place based, love/justice minded, skill/story sharing, serious/fun forum for exploring these questions together. Josh has facilitated workshops for transforming homescapes nearly a half decade, has worked in local food justice for about a decade, and has been sharing the earth through art for three wonderful decades, at homes, farms, and sacred sites all over the world. He holds an MA in Integral Ecology from CIIS and a BFA in Film from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. His work can be found at placeplaying.com and he can be reached at outsidejosh@gmail.com.

What are the subtle channels in the body? What is the function and purpose of working with the subtle energy? \r\n\r\nLearning to pay attention more closely to the subtle energy flow in our bodies during our yoga practices can begin to open our awareness in ways we couldn't, when we just focused on the gross body. We will work on developing an awareness of subtle energy and then explore various theoretical models we can apply in our practice to positively transform our body, mind and deepen our yoga journey.",

Then we will explore the possibilities that grid has to offer when you apply inspins, antispins, stalls and extensions to each quadrant, in various combinations. Once you know the basic theory and building block moves, you will be able to decipher and break down complex patterns you see other spinners execute. Most importantly, you will be able to experiment yourself and discover endless new patterns to play with.\r\n\r\nThis workshop assumes at least beginning   spinning skills.

Participants must commit to helping others complete the course, putting teammates before themselves, overcoming fears and occasionally administering booze to those who need more. The event is untimed, and may involve strong alcoholic beverages for additional challenge and fun. \r\n\r\nDon't miss your workouts, you lazy and/or overly indulgent Burner!  Your body will thank you when you're back next week in default world...",

    "description": "Vines Without Borders (Vines) is a global wine bar and lounge inviting guests and wines from around the world to convene for an unforgettable burn. Whether you’re an enophile (lover of wine) or a neophile (lover of new things) Vines is the first ‘port of call’ on your Caravansary journey. Our inviting venue features a lively lounge furnished with vintage couches and chairs, illuminated with LED lighting, showcasing a sleek LED back-lit bar designed and built especially for this burn. The Vines international wine theme is our unifying principle for global community and festivity. We will craft an intimate, interactive experience that provides opportunity for people from everywhere to drop in and enjoy discovering others on a deeper level, making connections that survive beyond the week. Our desire to connect stems from experience with our previous Camp Dawdle where we offered adventure rides on the Wheel of Passage. Guests loved the randomness and fun of the wheel rides, gave many thank-you hugs, but quickly moseyed on their merry way. It was unfortunately a fleeting interaction model. We felt we met many great souls but didn’t get to know any of them. With our new Vines concept, we increase our ‘stickyness’ with a cool wine lounge and an emphasis on international guests. Our wine focus and casual setting invites conversation while unavoidable language barriers ensure focused interaction, commitment to the moment and ultimately greater intimacy. Vines will bring together burners from around the world to make global connections around a unifying theme of wine.  In the spirit of Caravansary we will be a multicultural hub of interaction and wine sharing. We’ll enjoy the melody of world languages spoken throughout our camp and across our bar. Of course, we’ll also howl at our own grammatical gaffes while we resort to hand waving to articulate our most earnest points. What we’ll enjoy most will surely be the communion of the raised wine glass as we toast one another.",

If so, this workshop is for you! We will explore our relationship to Yin and Yang through breath, movement, and balance with a challenging, yet restorative partner asana practice. Blending the wisdom of yoga, the dynamic power of acrobatics, and the healing elements of thai massage, you will leave feeling empowered, as well as nurtured. No experience necessary. You don’t need to bring a partner, but feel free to bring friends if you got ‘em!",
