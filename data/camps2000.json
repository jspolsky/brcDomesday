This first questionnaire will be for The Body Hair Barber Shop, which is the largest camp of the four in Comfort Camp, and is the main artistic focal point. We will include for plotting purposes all the “general campers” on this questionnaire, with just the actual participants and specifics of the other camps on the other questionnaires. I hope that is ok. Located at Comfort Camp, at the Heart (archway) of the Black Light District, The Body Hair Barber Shop is back to continue the “temporary artistic enhancement and beautification” of the bodies (and minds) of the Citizens of Black Rock. Stop by our famous 2-story steel tent to get a body hair trim or color, or pick a part to paint and roll yourself onto the Body Bus’s giant canvases, then cajole or barter your way into the reflexology and chair massage tent, then finish your experience of comfort with a power mind session with our minister of Joy – it’s your week in the desert, so PAMPER your body and mind!",

See their bizarre reliquaries with your own eyes in the secret meeting place of this curious and ancient cult. Renew yourself in their luxurious sanctuary, make a mask, and discover hidden aspects of yourself long imprisoned by your conscious mind. As you fall under the spell of this pleasurable form of adornment, you will be transformed from a weary, dusty playa dweller into a thing of comeliness. Partake in the portentous rites of this weird tribe, and become a full-fledged devil-dancer by donning your sacred mask and purifying your soul.",
