    "description": "Intention:\r\n\r\nThe intention and purpose of the Alchemical Gender Circle is to increase understanding of the experiences we have as men and women, both with ourselves and with one another. This is facilitated by enhancing the capacity to listen to another’s experience and creating an intentional space in which we feel open to communicate our feelings. This was developed by me and influenced by the work of Avrom Altman. I have facilitated the circle in many diverse groups of people. Everyone from addicts in resident rehabilitation, parents of autistic children to art collectives and urban family tribes.\r\n\r\nProcess:\r\n\r\nThe process of the circle is in three phases. I am present to act as group facilitator and therapist. During the first phase, the women of the group gather to form a circle. The men in the group hold and contain them by forming a concentric circle around the women. Then the women are given the opportunity to speak about how they feel about\r\n\r\n·   Introduce themselves and what brought them here\r\n\r\n·   Their gender roles, both in their families and society.\r\n\r\n·   What romance and dating/partnerships means to them\r\n\r\n·   What they wish the men in their lives understood about them\r\n\r\nThe men are silent as they listen to the women’s process.\r\n\r\nDuring the second phase, the roles are reversed. Without comment, the men and women exchange places and the men move to the center circle and the women hold the space in a circle around them. The men speak about their gender roles and the women in their lives as the women listen to the men’s process.\r\n\r\nIn Phase 3, both the women and men gather in one large circle and speak about what the experience was for them.",

Some say it’s like teleportation into the mind’s eye of what could be, if we choose it. Some dance.

Couples and groups are particularly encouraged. This year I will be shooting only between hours of 4 and 7PM.  Please be patient if I am already working with someone when you arrive.  I will give you my card and take your email and postal address information.  Your print will arrive in the mail within several weeks to two months of the event; hand-printed gelatin silver prints are a very laborious process! Please don't wear clothes with tight rubber bands to the shoot, as we'll have to wait for the lines to disappear.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the idea is not as much to document Burning Man as to take a portrait of you set in the gorgeous desert.  Therefore, I will probably ask you to remove such things as glitter, body paint and temp. tattoos.  BUT PLEASE BRING PROPS!

Please join CBGB in a 2,500 year old yogi tradition of honoring the sun, Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutation).  The Sanskrit word namaskar stems from namas, which means \"to bow to\" or \"to adore.\"   Surya Namaskar, is a series of 12 postures performed in a single, graceful flow. Each movement is coordinated with the breath; Inhale as you extend and stretch, and exhale as you fold and contract. The Sun Salutation builds strength and increases flexibility while removing mental dirt, revitalizing your body, relieving stiffness and restoring balance.  This workshop is open to all individuals’ who possess a mat or towel, regardless of your experience.  See you on the playa, Namaste!",

By communing with the vixen within, she channels this energy, adds some sub-bass and creates a gypsy infused sauce of luscious whomp. Like a soft caress down the back of your neck, delicate twinklings of sultry highs lull dancers into a sonic womb, only to be enticed back into throbbing convulsions by another of her glitched out dubstep hip hop/gypsy infused bassy beats\r\n\r\nDj Jocelyn promises that she will increase the chance of your evening's coupling with that of sheer wild fun and yum. As the visionary co-founder and producer of Club Exotica she is sure to offer her sexy, gutteral, grinding, liquid-lithe mixes to lift the party's spirit ever higher. She drives your consciousness deep into your hips while furtive, cantankerous, sly, smiles blossom radiantly and dart from your eyes only to incorrigibly drape across your lips.",

    "description": "Come take sides in a week-long Black Rock gang war! New recruits are welcome any time, and will be initiated through unique rites of passage and get to choose squirt guns and different-colored bandannas signifying their clan membership. Throughout the week, potentially hundreds of warriors will be encouraged to hunt members of rival clans (identified by their prominently displayed bandanas) all across the playa, working independently or taking part in large pre-scheduled shoot-outs. Black Rock warriors killed by the opposing gangs must sign their killers' bandanas to signify the coup, and remain dead until they resurrect that night at sunset--unless they perform a mutually-agreed-upon service for their killer (such as a funny dance, a gift of food or alcohol, or something crazier), in which case they resurrect immediately. Band together with your friends and get to know your enemies as you hunt complete strangers throughout the week! Nowhere is safe, unless you take off your bandana--but then you can't shoot anyone either, and who wants that? Hunt for favors, to meet new people, to have your victory recorded in the camp's log book, or for the sheer honor of the kill!",

Unlike his forefather,  Bobby loves and embraces Burning Man and has no xenophobic tendencies.  That being said.  Bobby wants to use his Charisma and swiss gold to gain control of Burning Man (oh no!).  Bobby came up with an administration pack to keep everyone in order. \r\nLuckily, Bobby's Blond Japanese triplet sexrataries did not like the plot and \"influenced\" us to modify the wording and put the \"fun\" into these flyers.\r\n\r\nEach of the 50,000 flyers will be individualized for every participant,  and will have a bunch of games and jokes to go around.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, a new religious movement is included, And there even is a special coupon to help with decommodification.\r\n\r\nIn order to deliver all these 50,000 fliers,  we will need 32 volunteers Wednsday at 9:00, located around the rim of the city.  After this,  everyone who wants to play should yell out \"Gold for Goldie!\" - which is the secret code.\r\n\r\nAnd yes,  there are a select number of \"Golden Tickets\".\r\n\r\nLegal Eagleez:\r\nThis is a good leave no trace giveaway,  as the 9 miles of flyers are easy to pick up.   Overt corporate sponsorship is kept to a minimum,  and no-one has the guts to claim this as a tax write-off.  Bobby is a fictional character from the 1977 movie \"Boys from Brazil\",  but his sexretaries are real.  Goldie is a woman who has gifted love,  and should be gifted back all the gold in the universe.",

It's apparent that we cannot rely on the hirearchical systems that created the mess we're in to solve the problem. How do we shift the seemingly unstoppable, markedly unconscious, and appallingly unsustainable direction of our human race - now?  Our only hope is the emergence of a well-functioning, self-organizing human system where the body, mind, heart, and spirit are awakened.  Join Raj Sundra (social entrepreneur), John Taylor (business and intellectual marvel), Allison Coleman (transformational educator), Michael Costurus (Lakota spiritualist and student of plant medicine in Peru), and Kim Iglinsky (one of the Bay Areas premier EFT trainers and formerly a prominent Israeli runway model) in a panel discussion on how to cause the rapid emergence of an integrated human system to source the creation of a sustainable, just and fulfilling world for all.",

New channels of energy can open up in our system when this happens.  New ways of moving and expressing can present themselves.\r\n\r\nRope also contains an inherently erotic element.

Then we ride off on a meandering tour of the city.  Six host camps along the route will keep the icy cocktails flowing.\r\n\r\nWe’ll have mugs for the first 300 riders but bring a cup just in case.\r\n\r\nOur host camps this year will be Comfort & Joy, Barbie Death Camp & Wine Bistro, Celestial Bodies, Tribe, The Duck Pond, and the Naked Tiki Bar.\r\n\r\nSunshine, alcohol, and blatant public nudity...  It’s a playa tradition!  Find us on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=147170995353172",

    "description": "\"It’s not every day that a club owner sets his bar on fire to celebrate a great performance from a visiting band, but that’s just what happened when The BTB rocked the Isla Cantina. As the band dove into the Burning Man-themed crowd favorite “Gasoline,” a row of flame whipped across the top of the bar.\r\n“We were firing on all cylinders that night,” says singer & guitarist Brian Travis. “The place was packed & we were charged up. Our best shows don’t just rely on execution. They happen when we’re playing with great energy and the kind of momentum that pushes rock 'n roll forward, tapping into the spirit of the music itself.”\r\nTravis, Mark Wickliffe (drums) & Steve Wiel (bass) effortlessly mix classic rock with twangs of country & hints of the blues, giving traditional folk melodies a unique rock and roll vibe. With 5 albums of original content released, the core group of Travis, Wickliffe & Wiel continues to wow Los Angeles crowds with their own brand of heartfelt rock n roll.\r\n“The BTB show is real,” says Wiel. ” There is nothing staged, nothing scripted, hell, sometimes we don’t even have a setlist. Each show is like no other & you never know what’s going to happen.”\r\nThe BTB has worked hard to earn its place as a Los Angeles mainstay, & with plans for future material & an upcoming tour already in the works, the band won’t be taking a break anytime soon. There is simply too much burning passion in the band’s driven frontman. “We’re exploring all these different sides of ourselves right now,” Travis explains. “We’re planning to record an album with the country sound we’ve been exploring lately. But after that, we’re going to get back to the rock stuff– because that’s truly what’s in my heart.” - Erin Johnson, June 2010",

Meet our authentic Jewish Mother, present to dispense guilt and advice whether you want it or not. Make your own Yamulkah or join in a game of Strip Dreidel (beloved Hanukkah game with an adult twist). We will dance the hora, a traditional folk dance commonly known to break out spontaneously during Jewish parties and escalate in speed and enthusiasm to the point of ecstasy.  During This celebratory circle dance, random revelers are pulled into the center of the circle, seated in chairs and hoisted in the air by other dancers. Sin City will infuse these age old customs with hedonism and humor and bring to the Playa a RITE OF PASSAGE we like to call THE BURN MITZVAH.",

With that in mind, we are burners too and know that keeping track of time and space can be a huge challenge.  The Cache & Burn Banner/log book will be hanging on Faith's (Cookie & Faith) motorhome. If you stop by the BRCU (Black Rock Center for Unlearning) and sign the banner anytime during the week, you can claim this event. It's not very often that we get to meet Geocachers from all over the place in our neck of the woods.  What could be better than on a dusty playa in the Nevada desert? I can't think of anywhere I'd much rather be?\r\nAt least a couple of us will be wearing tie dyed T-shirts with Great Basin Eastern Sierra Geocachers in large white writing on the back.  We plan on meeting at the MAN for our annual group photo, trade travelbugs, pass out some schwag, and share our playa/geocaching stories.  Then...those that would like to join us, we'll be touring the C.O.R.E effigies as a group. As always, bring enough refreshments to keep yourself hydrated!",

Most experts agree the system will crumble under its own weight, but what will emerge to fill our human need to strive and better ourselves?  Engage in a dialog with Jennifer Russell and Bryan Franklin - cutting edge transformational educators, Danielle Strachman - director of Peter Thiel's \"20 under 20\" program, and other experts who answer the question, “What and how do we need to learn to be successful in a free world?”",

Please arrive clean.\r\n\r\nIn our day and age it is normal and often assumed that all baby boys are to be circumcised. Circumcision in our culture is thrust on the baby before he is given a chance to choose this irreversible physical change. \r\nThis one day event is an opportunity to choose and be completely aware of your rite of passage. Whether you have foreskin or not, all are welcome. Women are welcome to be a part of the ceremony as well.\r\nThe goal is to have a number of participants gather. Everyone has a chance to voice their personal feelings surrounding the subject of circumcision. (For example, any feelings of loss, resentment, thankfulness, hugeness, smallness, pain, joy, etc.) \r\nThe goal is to reach a universal sense of awareness and for every man to be complete in himself whether cut or uncut. \r\nAfter the discussion, the foreskin awareness ceremony begins: (privately or publicly, his/her choice on an individual basis) the prosthetic foreskin will be introduced to the penis.\r\n       A moment of recognition is experienced. (Can include but is not limited to incense, fanning with palm fronds, tears, prayers, chanting.) \r\n\tThe prosthetic foreskin is then painlessly peeled away, by choice and in full awareness.\r\n\tEach person gets to keep his/her own foreskin as a memento in an egg necklace.",

We get to focus our conscious awareness in the directions that we choose. By getting clear on OFNR, we develop competence to begin a journey into greater depths of our being.\r\n \r\nTHU Presence through Self-Empathy: several processes are introduced to help us to become consciously aware of our judgments, observations and the life energy within us. Through these processes, participants will gain valuable tools for self-connection, resulting in feelings of natural compassion, inner-peace and harmony.\r\n \r\nFRI The Flow of Empathy: after we are self-connected, we now have some free energy to offer our presence and respectful listening to others. We aren't there to fix people, but to help them get clear with their own life energy. In this session, participants will gain practical knowledge of what is empathy and what is not--and will have opportunities to practice and get feedback.\r\n \r\nSAT Spaceless-Timeless Presence of Empathetic Role Play: empathetic listening can help us to get clear with our pain relating to people who are not physically present. They may have passed on from this life, and we may have some unresolved hurts with them or others. The facilitator demonstrates the power of role plays with participant issues by taking on the spirit of their higher selves--in Christ consciousness.",

We are thouroughly queer, yet inclusive, with a definite chick-centric bent. Participation, inquiry, conversation, and owning your stuff are the name of the game.\r\n\r\nOur intention is to provide two things: a kick-ass Queer Oasis in Black Rock City for girls who LOVE girls, and a continuing conversation exploring female and feminine queer sexuality in the world and in BRC. Participatory in nature, Camp Beaverton, whether online or on the Playa, is a place where you are encouraged to explore YOUR expression of queerness and allow the rest of us to ask \"What is MINE?\"",

    "description": "Salsa Rueda de Casino\r\n\r\nRueda simply means \"wheel\". Casino refers to a place offering and live music and a place to dance.\r\n\r\nSalsa Dancing. Salsa is a style of music and dance that breaths rhythm and movement into one. Its origin expands from Afro Cuban/ Caribbean/ Latin American beat and culture.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Rueda unique is that the dancing is done in the \"wheel\", as a group, with a “caller” who determines the moves to been done at any giving time. Each move, or \"call\", has a name. After entering the circle (ideally with a partner, but not 100% necessary,) the leaders advance to the next follower in the wheel after a move or two is performed. This rapid changing of partners makes for a fun and friendly exchange all within the time of one song.\r\n\r\nMany of the moves also have hand signals as well as names, in order to be able to dance in a loud club setting. The Rueda can be as small as two couples, or as large as a space can hold — as many as a hundred couples. When the circle to too large for the space, concentric circles may be formed.\r\n\r\nWhen dancing Rueda, there is a new group dynamic that happens. What is not obvious when watching Rueda, is the new level of awareness required to have a group dance flow smoothly, and look sharp AND keep it fun! Dancers learn to open their sphere of awareness, their peripheral vision, beyond the normal restricted \"bubble\" of solo or partner dancing. In this way, dancers coordinate and adjust their individual feel and timing and style so as to make the Rueda \"click\". When this happens, it is very exciting indeed!\r\n\r\nGuest teacher - Doug Dirt of the French Maid Brigade",

It is important to note that, in line with BM's decommodification, gifting and immediacy principles, Kostume Kult's costume giveaway dome is not about giving products but empowering experiences. It is true that the sight of a dome full of free costumes makes eyes dilate, pulses quicken and drooling has been known to occur, but we request that you fight the consumerist urge to \"acquire\"-- to grab armfuls of stuff, to scurry away with thoughts of future times to wear or how there are others you want to supply. Instead we suggest that you stay in the moment, put something on that makes you feel special and that if you find something absolutely perfect and you see someone else admiring it, please consider taking it off and giving it to them. Playfulness, kindness and generosity are the coins of our realm and we hope you will share. Come by to participate and, if you have stuff to donate, please drop it off on-playa early in the week or, better yet, ship it to our Davis, CA logistics hub by contacting Jon at kkostumes@gmail.com to get the details.",

Since his first introduction to the party scene in the winter of 1993, he has been addicted to the music. He soon immersed himself in many aspects of the party scene and started breakdancing and doing graffiti, but didn’t start DJ’ing until 1997. \r\n\r\nAround 1996, he was throwing raves and was opening his own shows by playing his first musical love: hip hop. After seeing how much more the crowd responded to house and breaks, the transition of musical choice was swift and the first emergence of the DJ we now know as The Mener was born. Since his humble beginnings, The Mener has been throwing down funky house and breaks sets in most major cities in the U.S. and has opened for a colossal list of international superstars. \r\n\r\nWhether it be 50 people or 5,000 people, rest assured this 14 year turntable veteran knows how to destroy dancefloors!",

We're an oasis away from the scorching sun and from any responsibilities of the outside world.\r\n\r\nJoke telling is a huge part of our camp's experience and is integrated into our activities. With two large 30' tension tents, we have one that is high energy with music and a raging red sno-cone bar where people can laugh and play and another that is relaxing with cushions and chairs on the other side of camp where our guests can visit and get to know the people around them.\r\n\r\nIn addition we have a dodgeball court with multiple quirky themed games in a non-competitive friendly atmosphere.  Around camp there's a number of red self-tensioning hammocks for people to nap in or take a respite from the cruel sun and their explorations of the Playa.\r\n\r\nWe've also setup a mobile sno-cone crew to ride around the playa bringing sno-cones into people's camps.  We're outfitting them with an old timey \"ice cream man\" sound setup and we will be hunting for Burners in need of icy goodness.",

    "description": "Among Surrealist techniques exploiting the mystique of accident was a kind of collective collage of words or images called the cadavre exquis (exquisite corpse). Based on an old parlor game, it was played by several people, each of whom would write a phrase on a sheet of paper, fold the paper to conceal part of it, and pass it on to the next player for his contribution.\r\nThe technique got its name from results obtained in initial playing, \"Le cadavre / exquis / boira / le vin / nouveau\" (The exquisite corpse will drink the young wine). Other examples are: \"The dormitory of friable little girls puts the odious box right\" and \"The Senegal oyster will eat the tricolor bread.\" These poetic fragments were felt to reveal what Nicolas Calas characterized as the \"unconscious reality in the personality of the group\" resulting from a process of what Ernst called \"mental contagion.\"\r\nAt the same time, they represented the transposition of Lautréamont's classic verbal collage to a collective level, in effect fulfilling his injunction-- frequently cited in Surrealist texts--that \"poetry must be made by all and not by one.\" It was natural that such oracular truths should be similarly sought through images, and the game was immediately adapted to drawing, producing a series of hybrids the first reproductions of which are to be found in No. 9-10 of La Révolution surrealiste (October, 1927) without identification of their creators. The game was adapted to the possibilities of drawing, and even collage, by assigning a section of a body to each player, though the Surrealist principle of metaphoric displacement led to images that only vaguely resembled the human form.",

He determines that all the things we lose end up in an island of trash floating in the Pacific Ocean and in a desperate attempt to reclaim these things; he sets off on a scuba-diving journey to that island. Along the way he meets strange sea creatures, who trigger discoveries within his mind’s journey to determine how and why he began to lose Lillian.  The young man’s desire for love propels him further into the night, and into a swell of events he could never have imagined.\r\n\r\nJUNKraft is a boat built from 15,000 plastic bottles that sailed across the Pacific Ocean in 2008 to bring attention to the issue of plastic marine pollution. JUNK will be exhibited with a kiosk on plastic pollution built from waste salvaged from Hurricane Katrina. \r\n\r\nDisposable plastic waste, a byproduct of our ignorance and overconsumption, flows from land to sea through rivers and storm drains, getting stuck in massive, oceanic current systems called \"gyres\". Plastic accumulates in the gyres, breaking down into smaller and smaller fragments that are eaten by marine organisms. How might this affect human health? \r\n\r\nWe have a story to tell about a better future, and want to begin by bringing this message to Black Rock City, through a resurrection of the JUNK",

    "description": "Tired of workshops, spiritual practices, seeking and striving and trying to make things happen in the world?\r\n\r\nHow about just Following Life? How about letting go of the striving and seeking and, instead, just connecting intimately with whatever life is bringing to your awareness right now, in this moment? This feeling, this sensation in your body, this thought. How about following this, not analyzing it or trying to figure out, but just allowing it and following it till it reveals life’s wisdom?\r\n\r\nWhen we follow life we come into attunement with life. The struggle with life ceases, the tensions in our bodies, emotions and thoughts unwind and we open to the grace that is life. We make ourselves available to opportunities and possibilities greater than anything we could ever plan or strategize with our rational minds. Solutions present themselves, relationships heal and blossom, health and vitality expands and our sheer presence becomes a healing force in the world. \r\n\r\nFollowing Life sessions are gatherings where we hold space together to more deeply follow life. Led by experienced facilitators we sit or lie in a circle and practice connecting with and actively following the body sensations, emotions and thoughts that arise in our awareness. We alternate speaking what is arising in our awareness while others listen and follow what is happening in their awareness. We create a collective field that allows everything and anything to be present, to be felt, healed, balanced and transformed. We accelerate our spiritual progress and evolution while becoming more deeply human and connected.\r\n\r\nI have found these following life sessions to be the simplest, most grounded, yet powerful experience I have ever had and I love how deeply connecting they are with the people I come to meet and know through the practice. – RJ Noble, Bali\r\n\r\nTobin Giblin and Charlie Rebich, both long-time meditation practitioners and teachers, will facilitate these sessions on the Playa.",

Not only is fermenting your own foods a traditional way of reconnecting with the earth through your food, but eating fermented foods is a powerful healing tool for our bodies.  Plus, fermented foods are not only medicine, they taste incredible, and these processes are essential in creating some of the most pleasurable gastronomic flavors and sensations.  \r\nCome learn all about how you can start, or pick up some new tricks at this workshop.  \r\nThis will be followed by a fermented foods tasting and potluck, so please bring your creations to share w/ other fermented foodie lovers.",

Our theme/logo is “Let’s Cross Over” and we are looking at Geocaching as a way of promoting rites of passage and also the essence of our theme camp which is about marking significant transitions in the life cycle. Here are few golden words describing the gist behind our theme:\r\n \r\nLeave behind something you love or something that will help you move forward. What you leave will tell your story and will create a vibration in the space and time. What you take will walk along with you in your journey. Lighten your hearts and cross over the hurdles and let this box hold your treasures.\r\n \r\n You can find the container (cache) at our theme camp “Tattoo Oasis” located at 9:30 and Anniversary.\r\n \r\nQuick summary: \"GEOCACHING is real-world outdoor treasure hunting. Participant find Geochaching containers (aka. cache) and once found, they put something in the container and take something out of the container. They can also choose to log their experiences in a log book found inside the container.” For more info on what Geocaching is all about go to http://www.geocaching.com/ and if you have any questions or want more details you can contact geeti at “geetaroma@gmail.com”",

His family requested the creation of an arts event to give his death a positive legacy for the future.  In 2009 The \"Belfast Flags of Hope\" project was conceived and implemented as one way of helping to dismantle sectarian attitudes; and of trying to create a cultural atmosphere that will help to facilitate a brighter future.  There is a tradition of partisan flag flying in Northern Ireland that has always been highly contentious and divisive.  The Belfast Flags project seeks to use this divisive format in a new inclusive and positive way. \r\n\r\nPlease join me (Bebop) on the Playa to take a picture with the Belfast Flags. It is an international project and people are encouraged to take pictures with the Belfast Flags EVERYWHERE in the world...clearly the Playa is a place Belfast Flag Flying needs to happen! Wear your Burner Best and join us for a unifying photo!\r\n\r\nProject Organizer: Raymond Watson\r\nPlaya Organizer: Bebop",

The Hero will pull a sword from an enchanted scabbard, learn lessons from sage masters, unearth magical treasure, and solicit the favor of the gods. He or she will face a series of riddles on the course of an epic odyssey and ultimately lead an army of foam-sword wielding Burners into battle against the Evil Wizard.\r\n\r\nThe Hero’s Journey was inspired directly by the 2011 Burning Man theme Rites of Passage. It has toured festivals and festivities in the New York City region in preparation for this year’s Burn, most recently at Revolutionary War era Fort Jay on Governor’s Island in NYC.",

    "description": "Sunrise Meditation after the Welcome Home celebration to increase the resolution of our collective consciousness.  \r\n\r\nAs we revel, let us resonate so deeply with this experiment in community that we share the creations with Dreamers, Contemplators, Meditationists and those who believe in Imagining - anyone who can think Burning Man can join us in the experience as Creators.  \r\n\r\nThose whose Rite it is to carry the passage as a Bridge to the World. \r\n\r\nFor Those numbered 60,001+     \r\n\r\nWe'll meet in the music, in the dust and the mystery, in the fire and company of new friends, in the shared experience of life - inFuseMent - flooding this network with an awareness of our connection!  We welcome all travelers home!\r\n\r\nTHE STORY:\r\nIn 2002, I sent a piece of art intentionally to Burning Man - I couldn't go, but that year, and every year after, sent some piece of creation, in 2002, I sent a chalk drawing on wood with a Viking. That was the first year I remember dreaming of Burning Man.  \r\n\r\nAlthough I had never been, I understood it to be a place of Art created in celebration of what it is to be fully unfurreled, in manifestation with high winds to carry you.\r\n\r\nI was also beginning to more deeply study meditation and the dissolution of self.  I would not travel to Burning Man by person for another 6 years.  However, that year, by my dreams I began to travel to a place filled with light, creativity and vibration. Great fires (as in mythic-big!) and every human experience in outbursts of joy, anger, jubilation, fear, happiness, love - tears and laughter shouting and release - I began dreaming of Burning Man. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be years between these dreams and when I got my first ticket and traveled to Burning Man, American Dreamer, 2008.\r\n\r\nRecommended: study dream meditation, dream yoga and 'remote viewing'.  \r\n\r\nThis meditation is to strengthen the invitation to dreamers and other 'unseen beings' to join us in spirit as we celebrate creative culture wherever it is found.",

I have found a set of specific techniques that allow for love and acceptance to nourish and fill the body, leaving the body more whole and complete. The beauty of this work is once it is learned and embodied it is a set of skills that the participant can easily carry with them and practice on a regular basis. Through this work we are left with the Spirit and Soul more present and in charge, therefore being more able to be of service to the greater whole. I am a firm believer that we are not truly able to be of service to others until we have healed ourselves.",

Haramein's\r\ntheory demonstrates as well a parallel between ancient codes in\r\ndocuments and monuments.

There are many among us that believe your Rights of Passage occur after The BushWhacker's services (KittyTrim) have been performed. \r\n\r\nKittyTrim is the \r\nUltimate Pampering Experience!\r\n\r\nThe BushWhacker's tools of the trade are scissors and multiple electric razors. Trimming and designs, if desired, are performed first. Then a special electric razor designed specifically for very smooth pelvic shaving is used for the finishing touch. Since it takes approximately thirty to forty-five minutes to perform each service, there are only a limited number that can be serviced. The process is slow, but he tries to be very careful in making this your\r\nUltimate Pampering Experience!\r\n\r\nKittyTrim services are only offered Tuesday 10AM until 6PM with breaks for special events & food. The BushWhacker may at times be found in the Contraptions Chill room just next door where you can relax before your trim.\r\n\r\nPlease email baymtns@yahoo.com for appointment. If you have not signed up in advance, please come by to check for any open time slots.\r\n\r\nOwners are expected to keep their kitties under control.\r\n\r\nLocation: Contraptionists Camp",

This workshop will focus on practical tips on how to leave a fixed-place existence behind and explore a life of nomadism. Topics covered will include connectivity, constructing your ideal mobile home (wheels, sails, backpacks, or...), and legal issues such as domicile, voting, vehicle registration, and taxes. Immediately after the Living Nomadic Workshop there will be a Nomadic Happy Hour, so plan to hang around to mix and mingle with a bunch of other current and future nomads.

Bring your water and if possible, a stick that’s your height (3/4-1” bamboo, dowel, etc.)  We’ll have some available.\r\n\r\nMaster Mai Bac Dao developed the Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese Army.  He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain their health through LSA, and vowed that if he was ever freed, he would dedicate his life to spreading its benefits to the world, with the proviso that no future trainer could ever charge for the course. (Sounds like \"gifting,\" eh?)  He was freed, settled in Southern California, and started teaching classes of students and future teachers.  Today, LSA is practiced widely in Vietnam, and there are dozens of classes weekly around So Cal.  Also, LSA is spreading around the US, plus Canada, France, and Australia.\r\n\r\nMany more details are available at:\r\nwww.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html\r\nand www.filmbaby.com/films/2341 \r\n\r\nMaster Dao passed away late last year at age 89, and I was privileged to attend his funeral, and his last birthday party, a few months before.",

The Rite of Passage of Loving your True Self awaits you at the True Mirror Palace!  \r\n\r\nWhat goes on there is a look at yourself that you never usually see - your mirror image, but without being backwards!  The left right reversal changes you - not just your image, but who you are, how you are and what you really look like to others.  In a mirror you never get to see your true nature, your true self.  It really is a Rite of Passage to a fulfilling adulthood to know and love who you are, and if you do the dance right, you can really see that person in the True Mirror!  \r\n\r\nPlease note that not everyone sees this – it’s almost like the Emperor actually does have new clothes - can you see them?  If you can’t, maybe you are just staring - you need to be animated to see who you are.  Try to look in the True Mirror with a friend and/or try to really smile at yourself.  There’s light in your eyes that we get to see, but that the backwards mirror always dulls out and fades away.  It’s magic if you can see that sparkle in your eye!  \r\n\r\nTrue to Life, True to View, See the Lovely Person Others Do!",

The speaker is supported in the courageous act of speaking in the true voice without need of defenses, without interruption.  The rest of the members listen in quiet and deepening wisdom, hearing the synergistic echoing of brothers' voices.  We hear in these interwoven narratives, our own realities echoed and amplified, rendered in greater and more nuanced clarity.  In expressing ourselves within the tipi, while connected to the earth, the elements and the four directions, we access the codes of our authentic selves.  The circle is blessed with sacred smoke and instruments and and it is closed with the intention of a better life for all of those who have gathered.",

Sure, it may be no big deal, however it might be a big deal if you are consistently suffering or cursing your body for this cyclical occurrence. \r\n\r\nMenstruation can be seen as purely functional biologically, however, many cultures and traditions say otherwise. They viewed a woman's cycle as sacred and holy, sometimes, even cursed by the greatness of a woman's power during her bleeding time. \r\n\r\nWoman are often revered for their intuition and ability to create life through her womb. In honoring our mooncycle, we honor the gift we have to bring new life into this world, when we curse our blood, we're cursing our bodies, our children, the earth, and the gift of life itself. \r\n\r\nNow is the time to own the fullness of who you are as a woman; strong, beautiful, and full of love. Appreciate your body and all it does for you today and always! \r\n\r\nFor more info and to participate in a menstruation rite of passage, come to my other workshops on the playa listed as: Menstruation, A Rite of Passage for Every Woman!",

    "description": "Today's culture has mostly forgotten the value of rites of passage in general and specifically, menstruation. This gateway is a valuable moment in a woman's life, which when neglected can potentially bring forth self-created initiations which can actually endanger a woman's sense of self and bring forth greater problems for her and her community. Some examples of self-created initiations are teen pregnancy, overuse of alcohol and drugs, joining cults, and more. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of a rite of passage is to acknowledge a great shift in one's life journey. These happen at times such as, birth, marriage, death, moving cities/states/countries, etc. Our society has created ceremonies or rituals for these occassions: weddings, funerals, barmitzfas (spelling?) so why not the entering of womNhood, a woman's first blood? And the men are even worse off with no formal introduction or method by which to acknowledge their entry into manhood. Again causing similar non-beneficial initiations. \r\n\r\nSo what is the big deal or rite of passage that menstruation offers?  Simply put, it is the moment when a woman's spirit is anchored into her physical body to ground her into the earth reality. Not so simple maybe. We honor the girl's transition in ceremony with her community to welcome the fullness of who she us and who she is becoming. The strength of her community assists her in having the courage to stand fully in her body, spirit, heart and mind as one being. From this place, she can mature and grow into a woman who is rooted and supported. \r\n\r\nI have invited men to participate in this ritual because I believe the new age calls for gender alchemy which is harmony between the sexes. Men are called to stand as witnesses, pillars of support and compassionate listeners. We are one in the human family and shall stand together in community.",

It is about Holding Ones Own Voice Strongly while Listening To, AND Interlocking with, the Voices of Others in Community.  It is about releasing ones Voice and Body into greater freedom and expression.  It is about the Animal in our voice and our physical embodiment of animal.  There is also much purposeful laughter and improvisational voice exploration as well.All are welcome.",

We will also have activities scheduled for fun at the bar, check out our schedule when you come by. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not.

Once chosen, a short baptismal ceremony is performed by our very own Master of Ceremonies, a personalized badge is hand-drawn by our resident artists and offered to the person, who then sign or draw their newly-acquired Playa Name in our Book of Names.

The goal of the class is to increase mindfulness with regard to consent, communication and presence in their touch.

Finally, it will deliver a simple set of exercises in touch and communication that can help use TOUOCH more effectively and consciously, as well as emphasize the importance of mindfulness when touching other.",

To that end, we spent time considering the internal gifts our camp has to give, the needs of our community-of-Burners-at-large, the theme that will encompass all of us on the playa this year, and how to make people laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, we bring you: QUICKIE RITES OF PASSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe human experience, our shared experience on this Earth, is synonymous with change. The Rites of Passage that all peoples, modern and ancient, have concocted to navigate those changes, deserve  a place on the playa. Our camp believes that Rites of Passage, while critically important to human development, need not be painful. Who needs the long, drawn-out pain of childbirth, adolescence or divorce? Go through it quickly and painlessly at our walk-up service for Quickie Rites of Passage! Want a wedding without the stress of planning? No problem! We’ll have you hitched in under 5 minutes. Terrible time as a teen? Painful journey through your mother's birth canal? Awful first day of Kindergarten? Tripped on your gown at your college graduation? Want to be divorced from your playa partner RIGHT NOW? No problem!!! We'll complete or re-enact all of these rites -- and more -- in five minutes or less!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin us at “This Is Not The Camp You Are Looking For” on Friday and Saturday from 1pm to 3pm. Quickie Rites of Passage will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. Suitable costuming for all rites will be made available by our camp and we make absolutely no guarantee that they will be appropriate -- only amusing.",

People who practice Radical Honesty employ a collection of techniques to shift them out of acceptable norms of \"white lying\" for the purpose of having a more truthful relationship with themselves and others.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop we will cover Radical Honesty in business, personal interactions, legal situations, relationships, and SEX! Practicing Radical Honesty as an individual is hard, but it doesn't have to be. Me and people like me have developed a calm and peace from this practice. This does involve immense change in those who are used to telling white lies or lies in general.\r\n\r\nIf you are ready for a RADICAL change in your life or you just want to learn about this crazy practice, come to Practicing Radical Honesty for Beginners.",

    "description": "Held at Red Lightning's Rites of Passage Dome. \r\n\r\nSomething deep and profound happens in consciously choosing to step into transformation. Choosing a ceremonial Rite of Passage is a gateway into understanding ourselves, our life journey, and our place within our communal ecosystem. Without Rites of Passages in our culture we lose the bond of community connection forged through witnessing and supporting one another on our journeys. Learn about the four stages of initiation and transformation, what stage you currently are at in your cycle, and the tools that can assist you at that stage. You will then be led in a practice to gain clarity on your destiny path and the intended gift you are to bring to serve the greater community. This workshop combines practices from many lineages of Rites of Passages, including Tibetan Buddhism, the Q’ero Shamans of the Andes, and modern Wilderness Therapy.\r\n\r\n\r\nShena is a Transformation Coach, Ecotherapist, Shamanic Counselor, and Rites of Passage Guide. She has been initiated by Rites of Passages into several lineages including the Q’ero Shamans of Peru and Tibetan Buddhism, and is a Certified Wilderness Vision Quest Guide and Rites of Passage facilitator. She was passed the Ritesof the Munay Qi from the Shamanic lineage and learned to weave earth medicine into energetic and psychological healing on the individual and community levels. \r\nShe has experience guiding others through a variety of Rites of Passages, including 10 day Vision Quests which involve fasting in the wilderness for both adolescents and adults, as well as weekend Rites of Passage workshops for both men's and women's groups.\r\n\r\nShena is the Co-Founder of Sacred Living Institute (www.sacredlivinginstitute.com), an organization dedicated to awakening and embodiment of the soul self through Rites of Passages, Wilderness Therapy, and Contemplative Practice. She is also the Co-Founder of Critical Beats for the Climate, a non-profit that serves the people of the Amazon.",

Lydia is a certified Dancing Freedom facilitator and will be offering these journeys throughout the playa this year. \r\n\r\n\r\nDancing Freedom is a somatic, ecstatic and shamanic dance practice supporting the emergence of living oneness and what it truly means to be embodied. It is fun, and empowering. Any person of any age, size, color or creed can do it. We explore the ways in which the 5 elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether may assist us in creating a deeper relationship to our Selves, others, and our environment. By having an experiential understanding of how these elements work within us, we gain tools that help us to move through life and all of its lessons in a more centered and conscious manner. When we come together we come in peace to create a deep space of shared practice, transformation and community.\r\nAll one needs is the desire for health, vitality, happiness and a deeper connection to self and others. This is a free form movement practice that is safe for all abilities. It is a friendly entry point into movement as medicine and it’s a powerful addition to an existing yoga, meditation or healing practice.  For more exciting information check out the Dancing Freedom website:www.dancingfreedom.com <http://www.dancingfreedom.com/>",

Come early to claim an original work of thong-art! While you're there, learn about the SIGN POST FOREST and help it grow. COME FIND WHO YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE MISSING! We've made it easy to build community on and off the Playa. You can find people right from your own hometown by creating a groovy fluorescent sign and posting it with your hometown and Playa address. As other BRC citizens visit the forest, they will add their Playa address to the back of the sign, too! Check back frequently to see who's in your hood, and arrange a meet-up with all the beautiful people you didn't know before! We'll be hosting signpost workshops ad hoc all day on Tuesday and Wednesday. And be sure to visit the Sign Post Forest at night for a spectacular UV experience!",

    "description": "The now infamous camp challenge is back. With origins dating all the way back to the 1980s, this camping tradition has morphed into something truly monstrous. During the heat of the day, in triple digit temperatures, one must eat a helping of five-alarm chili, cooked with the dreaded Guatemalan insanity pepper (grown only by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum). Then, to wash it down, a shot of hot pepper vodka, also infused with the same insanely hot pepper. Now, when you want nothing more than an ice-cold beverage to quench the fire burning in your mouth, you instead must chug a cheap, warm beer that's been sitting out in the sun since daybreak. Why, might you ask, would anyone want to do this? Hell if we know! It's a terrible idea! It's a horrible thing to conceive, much less do on purpose! Yet, as demonstrated by the droves of people who participated AND completed the challenge in 2009 and 2010, we apparently underestimated human nature. Not only did crowds show up for the challenge, but they returned over the course of the week to to share the pain with their friends. And by share, we mean point and laugh while grown men cried and stumbled down the street in a daze. We even had a university anthropologist come hangout, just to observe this odd aspect of human behavior.  We're bringing it back spicier than ever for 2011!",

Giant, dusty gonads. Can you hang?\r\n\r\nInstead of a gong, DJs will wear a shock collar and get buzzed off stage by volts of harsh rejection if they fail to impress. Instead of regaling us with tap dancing, DJs break out their most mind blowing tracks and slickest tricks. Instead of a paltry sum to commemorate victory, winners will be invited back during peak hours to pound the dance floor into submission. \r\n\r\nThis is open decks for the fearless. Bring it.",

The self-referential hype, the notion that there is always someone else having more fun, and that you are always missing the good stuff can create an insurmountable right-of-passage. _____ The SpaMarine mutant vehicle will wander the playa, seek out those individuals who are having a rotten time, those who need a break from the fuzzy neon stimuli and missed connections. The SpaMarine will take in one person at a time and offer them a customized spa experience within a private, soothing, calm, and quiet environment. _____ No booze-laden party car, taxi-service, or overly cushioned snuggle-nest, the SpaMarine is instead a safe womb that comforts, recharges, and reassures those who are feeling lonely, sad, or out-of-place. _____ \r\nOUTSIDE:\r\nThe SpaMarine will entice a few participants to see past its cold exterior and dare to enter its comforting interior. The carefully fabricated exterior will impress with its faithful impression of a submarine and delight with its incongruity amongst the typical fantastical creations roaming the playa. While waiting for your personalized treatment, get a different perspective on the playa and calm yourself on our intimate outdoor second level. _____      \r\nINSIDE:\r\nOnce inside the isolated and dust-free environment, a staff member may offer the single participant massage, aroma therapy, hard to glean insider information, comforting discussion, and interaction with a few familiar objects from the \"normal\" world. In conjunction with Playa Name Help, at the conclusion of your visit we will provide you with meaningful and respectful playa names to help you continue your own personal right-of-passage.",

Come to pay, cuddle, meet new people, whatever you want.  Our motto, voyeurism is participation.  \r\n\r\nWe will supply safe sex supplies and a few toys, but please bring your own if you have some.  \r\n\r\nOur dome is a safe space for women identified people.  If you have any questions about the gender boundaries or how you fit into them, please speak to any Camp Beaverton or Gender Blender member and we can answer any questions you have.  Arrive early or pop by our camp anytime.  \r\n\r\nCamp Beaverton for Wayward Girls is your queer oasis in BRC.  Join us for an old fashioned Lesbian Mixer in the dessert.  We will play our version of Spin the bottle which we call Spin the monkey.  Meet your future ex-playa girlfriend in a friendly, safe sexy space.  Our dome is women-identified 24/7. Bring your own cup. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Camp Beaverton: Camp for Wayward Girls\" is an intentional (and experimental) Burning Man community camp AND conversation. For who? For Gay and Queer Women (identified), Dykes, Bykes, Sluts, Butches, Bois, Trannies, Lesbians, Geekster-Hip Lezzies, Lesbos, Lipstick Lesbians, the Bi-identified, the Bi-curious, the Hetero-flexible, and even (gasp!) the occasional Straight Girl (as long as she's as Wayward as the playa is dusty). We are thouroughly queer, yet inclusive, with a definite chick-centric bent. Participation, inquiry, conversation, and owning your stuff are the name of the game.",

It is very hot, but it isn’t sex; there is no sexual interaction between the giver and receiver except for the massage, and boundaries will be respected.

The workbook, The Alchemist’s Path contains elemental imagery that Sunny painted from a series of “Big Dreams”. These images are based in alchemy and a visual, elemental and spatial narrative. Each of us creates a “life story” in which we give meaning to our lives. The intention of the imagery and exercises in this presentation are to facilitate a beginning of reclamation- to give meaning and importance to our life stories.\r\n\r\nWe will examine how during our lives, we have traveled through four alchemical regions as wee have walked our individual Hero’s or Heroine’s Journey, represented by the elements, water (Solutio), Fire (Calcinatio), Air (Sublimatio) and Earth (Coagulatio).\r\n\r\nWe will view these stories through the lens of Jungian, archetypal, and depth psychology, and explore concepts in mythology, alchemy, archetypal imagery, and depth psychology and how they relate to the symbols in both our waking and dreaming lives. If time allows, we will process experiential exercises which follow the path through the four elements. Using the images from the workbook, we have an evocative starting place. The written and practical exercises are intended to help facilitate the audience’s reclamation and integration of these archetypal realms.\r\n\r\n“We must let art help us.” (Hollis, 2000)",

You’ll discover the possibility of reconnection with your innate beauty, wholeness and be honest with yourself and and with others in a safe circle of love. You can discover those places you’ve felt stuck, while you are supported in letting go. You learn to become aware of those times when you get in your own way, and come to see the choices open to you. You embrace what you desire the most, and deeply commit to letting your dreams and your visions be more important than you past wounds. You will find yourself reconnecting with your innate beauty, wholeness and power in each moment.\r\n\r\nHeart of Now workshops include numerous assistants to support you and to create a sacred space for transformation. A deeply nurturing environment is created. This teamwork approach deepens the experience of service and camaraderie, where all are able to experience their vulnerabilities, allowing trust and growth.

You may have seen it at Spanky’s Wine Bar [RIP]. \r\n\r\nThis year we’ve taken it that much further with a singular goal of maximizing our guests’ overall pleasure, along with the comfort and sensuality of the environment. \r\n\r\nWhen you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, and deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience in an environment that is safe, comfortable and private, and which leaves you feeling completely respected and in-control. \r\n\r\nCome solo, or better yet, bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and personal experience. \r\n\r\nYou can wear as much or as little as you would like while riding this marvelous machine, and you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. \r\n\r\nIf you are a woman, the Orgasamator Experience at our I-Scream Parlour is something you won't want to miss. Visit us at the Camp of Sensual Pleasures, and also ask about The Pope’s Massage & Hair washing.",

Participants will write their transformation story, find completion with the past, engage with the creation of a conscious identity, and use the power of group process and a ritualistic container to embrace and embody their future self NOW. \r\n\r\nThis is for you if you have been suffering and are ready to let go of the struggle, if you want to become more magnetic, confident and luminous, if you want to step into leadership, or if you simply want to complete a phase of your life and step into the next one in a considered, conscious way. This process assists you with evolving into your vision of your highest self by bringing your future vision into present time so that you may become the person you imagined you could be but didn’t known how to access.",

This authenticity contributes an energy of spiritual legitimacy to the project. The 5-tone tuning system of the gongs reflects the 5 cardinal directions of the universe (North, South, East, West and Center). When they are rung they conjure the god energies of the greater universe into the space. Gamelan music in Bali is often present in temples as part the spiritual practice of making and purifying offerings for the Gods.\r\n\r\nThe instruments the Gamelatron will use are from the traditional ensemble known as Beleganjur. Beleganjur is most commonly used in ceremonies to accompany the body of the dead to its pyre. The music purifies the space around the body, scaring off the evil spirits that would stray the soul from its destiny to be released in fire. The temple at Burningman is destine to burn, and with it the release of prayers and intentions of an entire community. The songs of the Gamelatron foster an alchemic transformation of these prayers and intentions while creating a sacred space to the temple grounds.",

St Stupid,is a little known saint,4'2'', patron saint of civilizations and parking meters, who manifests him/it self, unavoidably in the human DNA. To give homage to this universally shared glitch/flaw/feature, the FCLL  puts on a parade thru the SF financial district, on weekdays and thru North Beach on weekends. Lead by Bishop Joey, the weekday route stops at the various Stations of Stupid in its yearly attempt to exorcise the buisness of religion and the religion of buisness. The Taberknuckle of stupid will transplant some of these rituals to the playa in order to spread the stupid face and the stupid word...which is , oddly enough, 'stupid', to the dusty masses.If you're human your already in the church, along with 7 billion others. Come to the Taberknuckle to be 're-membered' thru the rites and lefts of the world's fastest growing 'snack-religion', 150% less dogma, its a lite religion, one hole-y day a year, and this aint it. A self guided re-membrance tour will be available at all hours and some minutes. The full tilt high production value entertainment extravaganza that is the HI MASS for the MASSES will be conducted by Bishop Joey and the deep phat friars every once in awhile after sunset. Come see the sistupid chapel ceiling of wonderment. Partake in the microphone of confessional shame and relief. Sign up for the 2 minute talent show.Get the tatoo. Find out where the tatoo removal office is. Do the LEAP of FAITH. Learn the secret handshake. Exchange socks!! Be exposed to the the teachings of the world's most dangerous religion...just for laughs. Find out how St Stupid operates in your life and how to channel his/her/its unavoidable inflluence to win the lottery of luck, love and liberation. Egalite/Fraternite/Absurdite. So far...so what. remember, don't forget...or ?",

All you need is your body and soul.   \r\n\r\nWe offer bouquets to hold and rings and vows to keep.  We take your wedding photo and you can grab it off the website.  Pre-printed multiple choice vows can be used as inspiration  or you can check off the boxes.  A sample of the vows is on the site.\r\n\r\nYou may bring your own rings and vows.   It’s your wedding, after all.\r\n\r\nWant the mini-exorcism/divorce from past selves? Just ask. \r\nit's on the form.  \r\n\r\nWe are happy to accommodate you as deep as you're willing to go.\r\nIt's your wedding.   Wear whatever makes you happy - costumes are welcome. It's your ceremony.   \r\n\r\nFriends and Groups may attend at your discretion or you may go it in private.  It's your wedding.  \r\n\r\nYou can even take vows together, but you would not be marrying each other.  Each one to his-herself. \r\n\r\nIt's kitschy and celebratory, but honestly, there is power in the vows. \r\n\r\nYou fill out the form, add what you like to it, and when you're done realizing that you deserve as much love, support and discipline as you give and expect from others -  take it home as a personal contract. \r\nIt's all you, baby.

The exterior has all the visual cues, from the shingled roof, to the paneled siding, shuttered windows, etc. The inside is furnished with vintage furniture, 50’s wallpaper, elegant light fixtures, hardwood flooring, and hilarious photos from “Grahama’s” life on the walls. A working ceiling fan will cool the guests while they eat hard candy and experience the creature comforts of plastic covered sofas and creepy pictures from Grahama’s life. As a bonus, an actual “Grahama” will guilt trip you about your naughtiness and simultaneously make you feel like the specialist little boy/girl. It’s as if your real grahama were on the playa with you!\r\n\r\nTo celebrate her first year on playa we are having an all night party with live bands perched atop the roof! Granny may be old, but she knows how to party!",

Columns of Burners will pull the 20-ton beast on its massive cart across the playa and through the Gates of Troy to where the beast will burn.   A large procession with loud, cacophonic music will accompany the migration. The music, composed by Douglas Bevans, will be interactive and performed by a massive corps of drummers and brass players. The procession of costumed Greek deities and Greek and Trojan mortals will be solemn, the death march and last rites for the horse. We believe this will be one of the largest and most spectacular pieces of performance art ever brought to the playa.  Once the horse passes through the Gates of Troy, pure pandemonium (led by Pan) and a full-scale celebration with DJs and a powerful sound system will erupt. At midnight Artemis, Apollo, and their band of archers will shoot flaming arrows onto the upper reaches of the beast. Zor the Fyre God will finish torching the horse. In a spectacular conflagration, the horse will burn quickly and the party and dancing will resume around the fallen beams and embers. A riotous night of revelry (some orchestrated) will follow. Dionysius reigns!",

We like orgies, and we are always horny!! At burningman we are having a stampede, taking our unbridled joy and annoyingly perky enthusiasm across the playa. Join us! We will be galloping around making a nuisance of ourselves, stampeding through people's camps spreading our intolerably positive energy throughout the festival. We will start at the Man and then stampede around who knows where as the sun sets. We will provide horns and other unicorny costuming to those who are horn deficient. We really can't wait to meet you! Squeeeee!",

They are worn by belly dancers for traditional Arabic Dance. Egyptian waist-bands were worn by men.\r\n\r\nAfrican women wear waist beads to celebrate femininity, fertility, healing, spirituality, balancing and energy. The Seven Chakras share many of these aspects—balance, healing, love, sexuality, courage, self discipline, creativity, and enlightenment.

We are thouroughly queer, yet inclusive, with a definite chick-centric bent. Participation, inquiry, conversation, and owning your stuff are the name of the game.\r\n\r\nOur intention is to provide two things: a kick-ass Queer Oasis in Black Rock City for girls who LOVE girls, and a continuing conversation exploring female and feminine queer sexuality in the world and in BRC. Participatory in nature, Camp Beaverton, whether online or on the Playa, is a place where you are encouraged to explore YOUR expression of queerness and allow the rest of us to ask \"What is MINE?\"",

Come to this 90-minute class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms:  flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right.  With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy.  In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.",

Since popping up the laptop and logging on isn’t an option, we’ll just have ourselves an addiction party instead.\r\n\r\nOpen to all everyone, gamer or not, we’ll have a little gathering Saturday afternoon. Anyone who has completed our daily quests, or just wants to hang out and get their fix is welcome. Our resident mad alchemist has come up with some special brews, and servings of delicious chocolate cake are available to all. If any of our \"Dragonbreath\" chili remains, it’s a great time to polish that off. Hang out, drink some \"kungaloosh\", take down a \"sulfuron slammer\", and swap war stories of \"How I wiped the 40 man raid\".",

Refresh and reorient yourself to the possibilities of the playa.\r\n\r\nYoga nidra is a deep meditation practice that mimics the stages of actual sleep; it’s like sleep with a trace of deep awareness that opens portals to your unconscious mind.  Swami Satyananda Saraswati is one of the first to have codified teachings from early Vedic literature into eight stages of practice.  Christy Anandaconda will lead you through a nidra practice in Swami Satyananda’s framework that includes breath play and exploration, also drawing upon Donna Farhi’s inquiries into current breathing and Blandine Calais-Germain’s discussions on the anatomy of breathing.  Bring or create an intention that you would like to work with, something you would like to manifest in your own life.  In yoga nidra, this is called a sankalpa, and it focuses your mind at the beginning and end of the practice.  Meditate with this sankalpa until the manifestation you desire occurs.  Yoga nidra will help you absorb this resolve at the cellular level.",

The remarkable sonic vibration of the Earth Harp creates ascending overtones and healing harmonics that not only provide the perfect soundtrack for the yoga practice, they also transmute and sublime one's energy to promote physical/energetic health and creative inspiration. Joined by William on the Earth Harp, Andrea Brook will lead a class, suitable for all levels of practitioners, through the physical yoga practice, guiding one’s conscious attention to the emotional and psychological responses, and inspiring the spirit to soar. MASS (Music, Architecture, Sonic, Sculpture) Ensemble is an internationally renowned performing arts group that combines unique musical sculptures and installations with traditional instrumentation, creating an unforgettable multi-sensory experience. The Earth Harp places the audience inside the instrument, as the golden strings span out from the stage and use the Temple of Transition to create a 120 foot harp.",
