There is no need to arrive with a partner - most dancers swap after each dance.  Lines of couples flow through each other creating a bonding, playful, noncompetitive, all-ages community dance.  There is no required footwork and contra is possible for many with disabilities.  If you are smiling, you are doing it right.  Everyone who shows up will have fun.",

We especially love our 'Spaceship Earth' and include dialog about the most special of planets by covering biology, conservation, ecology, sustainability, and human society. We print and gift gorgeous large scale images, from the extra-galactic (i.e. Hubble telescope), mega-scopic (satellite imagery), to the micro-scopic (i.e. light and electron microscopes).  Take home gifts such as compasses, sun-dials, star maps, and more which we 3D print or laser cut ourselves.",

Proceeding further into the 747 fuselage, they will be asked to fill out an Emotional Baggage Tag, to let go of anything holding them back.  Once completed, they hang the tag on the wall of baggage handles. Next, a flight attendant asks them for their destination (where they are going on their journey through life), which will be shared on a Boarding Pass.  This pass is hung onto the Destination wall.

    "description": "Electric Kool-Aid Vision Quest brings its special brand of free love to the playa for the second time in 2017 after four years as a theme camp at Firefly, New England's regional burn. We provide a beautiful lounge space with a dance pole and glow-in-the-dark purple heart bar, serving what else but Electric Kool-Aid. A major focal point at our parties are the resident dancers who show off their pole skills, as well as teaching newcomers basic pole skills allowing for participatory fun for all! We host several parties throughout the week, with entire camp participating in the production of these events offering a welcome environment for all burners to drop in, grab a drink and mingle on their way out to playa.\n\nThe Reflection Tree, a two-meter tower of 2,160 LEDs with a sensor array that picks up and redisplays the most saturated color in every direction. The LEDs change over time as they flow up, allowing the viewer to \"go back in time\" by viewing the colors of previous playa passers-by.",

When dust, deep conversations, and occasional screams of rapture have done a number on your vocal cords, we have what you need. An assortment of electrolarynx machines are available for use in our comfy, shady lounge. Bring your friends and have a monotone robot voice singalong. We also offer smart device technology called The Whisper App. Whisper a soliloquy into our devices with the app, and it's repeated  out loud for all to hear. We offer refreshing iced tea, chai and kombucha, (bring your own cup!), snacks, cough drops, throat sprays, plenty o' popsicles, chill music and good vibes. Losing your voice is fun.",

Draw elephants, trumpet for elephants and more. We have yoga! See our schedule in the program guide!. Meet our conservation group's director who is equally nuts for elephants. You'll love elephants even more as he shares stories over beverages and snacks. Oh, and we've been told our misting system is best ever on the playa! The misting equipment design is one of a kind!",

During our full service repair hours you will never stand in line. Simply take a number, grab a refreshment, chillax, socialize in our lounge, and let our attentive staff wait on you. We'll also have an interactive mural, photo booth, and crazy games to entertain you. When our Gods are off duty or if you can handle simple repairs, our DIY Bike Portals are stocked and available 24x7. Out on the Playa, look for our Lanterne Rouge art car. After midnight, look for our bike-drawn Shangri-Lounge martini bar \"somewhere\" out in deep playa. If you can find it, we offer classy, table-side cocktails in lounge comfort while listening to the sounds of Frank Sinatra and other great analog waves of goodness.",

    "description": "Naked Heart is devoted to the full embodiment of the divine feminine. We offer amazing experiential and experimental workshops that allow you to feel your feminine heart your radiance your inner goddess. This work requires the masculine as well; Everyone is welcome.\r\n\r\nAt Naked Heart we recognize the need to embrace both the light and the dark in our journeys. When we pursue the light we use movement, the senses, sensuality, sexuality and connection.  This beckons us in and brings the light of awareness back into the bodies we have vacated. We are particularly interested in the seat of power and intention housed in our bodies. To go there fully requires confronting our shadows. We embrace those as well as we dive into shame, fear, anger, unsavory memories from this life and past lives, and disempowering images of our bodies. Welcome home.",

Rather than being a performance in which the audience listens to musicians, it is a participatory spiritual practice in which everyone is encouraged to sing and express their inner joy.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Song Teahouse is a Burning Man camp dedicated to creating and maintaining a serene temple oasis for joining our voices and diving into the Divine... together. We welcome the keepers of tea wisdom to join us in our temple space to sooth our throats with their mystical infusions. We welcome musicians to join us on stage and have a safe and secure place for them to store their instruments during the Burn. Together we create Magic!",

We integrate ancient esoteric teachings of tantra with modern self-development techniques to create a unique environment for experiences that prepare the ground for evolution. To envision and prepare the world of tomorrow we need to rewire our nervous systems and free ourselves from the old paradigm. Tantra is an accelerator of evolution. The context of Burning Man serves as an amplifier to these ancient Tantric techniques. The collective ambition towards freedom present during Burning Man is unique. It erases differences between individuals and supports the Tantric effort of transcending all false dualities. From regular morning energetic practices to one-of-a-kind ceremonies and ritual, Tantra Mantra embraces and promotes the change towards a new human agreement. We leave a great place for spontaneity... Expect the unexpected.",

We believe each and every Playa Dweller has a fairytale hidden inside of them, and our camp helps these stories (especially the most wicked ones) emerge and see the light of day… or night!\r\n\r\nDo you think you need to speak to tell your story? Do you think you need words to understand somebody you just met? The Wicked Mash Machine will free you of these perceptions. It's part-game, part-performance, part-experience and YOU are at the very centre of it. Use the cube in the centre of the dome to create patterns of lights and sounds, collaborate with others and see what wickedness emerges!",

We've become skilled at recognizing when people are ready to change direction, and helping them dig out and uncover ideas about what those new directions might look like.\r\n\r\nMagic and ritual use a combination of physical, emotional, and mental transformations that work. They've been developed and tested for tens of thousands of years, across every culture known to man, and keep converging on the same basic methods *because* they work. While modern culture provides many benefits - ready access to food, to health care, to shelter, to conveniences and entertainment and distraction - those same benefits can separate us from the flow of life that we originally evolved within. Magic and ritual seem so powerful to modern humans precisely because, for the most part, they have never experienced them directly.\r\n\r\nLet's fix that.",

Through the music and art, the participants will express themselves using their unique gifts.  The Monkey Hut community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We think for people to go from listening to music to making music can transform and individual.  Everyone is invited to play music and craft with us.  Through making music and crafting together we seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves.  There is no substitute for immediate experience.",
