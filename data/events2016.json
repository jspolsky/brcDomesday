    "description": "2016 Black Rock City Air Guitar Championship - Esplanade & 6:45\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL RULES OF COMPETITION:  \r\n \tEach performance is played to 1 minute (60 sec.) of a song\r\n \tThe 60 second song will be provided to you from a list of 100+ tracks to choose from\r\n \tThe instrument must be invisible & be a guitar, i.e. air drums not allowed\r\n \tAir roadies are allowed, but must leave the stage before the performance\r\n \tBack-up bands (air or real) are not allowed\r\n\r\nBlack Rock City Air Guitar contests each consist of two rounds:\r\n\r\n \tRound 1 (freestyle): each competitor performs to a song of their choice from the list\r\n \tRound 2 (compulsory): top competitors from round 1 perform surprise song\r\n\r\nJUDGING CRITERIA:  \r\nThe jury is a panel of independent judges. The results of the jury cannot be protested. All performances are scored on a scale from 4.0 to 6.0 – 6.0 being the highest possible. Scores are given to one decimal point (e.g. 5.4, not 5.48). A single score is given to each air guitarist based on their overall performance in that round.\r\n\r\nThe score reflects the quality of the performance based on three key criteria:\r\n\r\n1.\tTechnical merit - You don’t have to know what notes you’re playing, but the more your invisible fretwork corresponds to the music that’s playing, the better the performance.\r\n2.\tStage presence - Anyone can do it in the privacy of their bedroom. Few have what it takes to rock a crowd of hundreds or even thousands – all without an instrument.\r\n3.\t“Airness” - The last criteria is the most difficult to define yet often the most decisive of all. Airness is defined as the extent to which a performance transcends the imitation of a real guitar and becomes an art form in and of itself.\r\n\r\nPlease note: the scores from BOTH ROUNDS are added to determine the contestants’ final scores. This combined score determines the winner.  Earn the title of Black Rock City Air Guitar Champion!",

    "description": "Beekeepers and wannabees come together for a hivemind discussion of all things bee.  Want to be a beekeeper but don’t know where to start?  Live in an urban area but have concerns about zoning &/or neighbors?  Have a theory on sustainable varroa mite management?  Opinions on which bee between the Italian, Carnolian, Russian, & Africanized bees make the best honey? Healthy Queen propagation and management?  How about a pollen patty recipe you want to share? We will discuss Beekeeping 101, suggest excellent reading materials, and who knows?  You may even have a little honey on your lips as you depart!  If a flock is to seagulls, what’s a group of beekeepers?  An argument!!!  (This summit does not require prior experience—we encourage wannabeekeepers to attend as there will be a lot of BuzzInn going on)!!!  Beek out with us!  Find us near the Do More Now's 7 story firehouse on 7:30 & Beeeeeee!",

Reaching out into every direction of your universe and expanding consciousness with the breath, we can reactivate the energetic body together. \r\n \r\n We'll be delving into how to realign the spine, our antenna to unity consciousness using acro yoga paired with kundalini energetic healing. The physical body is the intermediary for every dimension of our existence. By arousing kundalini energy the practitioner can activate third eye so that the distortions may be witnessed as they are released.\r\n \r\n We are our own best healer.

In Actoroke, you and a friend pick a scene from a popular movie to act out. We will have a full film crew setup, complete with 3 cameras (wide master, and one on each actor), wireless lapel mics for each actor, 2 teleprompters (one for each actor, in their eye line), and a truss and lighting setup.\r\n\r\nYou will be directed by our camp’s filmmaker, Hoss Hitchcock, who will help you through your performance. Come get the full experience of acting and being directed.\r\n\r\nThe video feeds from all three cameras will be displayed in the “video village” where your friends and strangers can watch your performance!\r\n\r\nIf this sounds fun but you don’t want to act, then try your hand at running a camera or teleprompter!\r\n\r\nWed & Fri 10:00 pm to late",

    "description": "Hi everyone, come and get PLASTERED! ;o)\r\n\r\nWe humbly invite you all to “Becoming the Master/Mistress of Stones: The Arts of Buon Fresco!”\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Burning Man Guild Workshops! For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. \r\n\r\nWe, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! \r\n\r\nHere’s the scoop:\r\n\r\nApprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat’s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: “All You Need Is Love.” The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.",

Now is the PERFECT time to integrate the endings, awakenings, transformations, death and rebirth experiences related to the self and others and to welcome a more balanced exchange between the masculine and feminine as well as man and woman.\r\n\r\nImbalances in females sometimes shows up as feminine infections, shame, control and dis-empowerment issues, suppression of desire, and feelings of inadequacy.  In males it may present as an unfulfillment of sexuality cravings and desires or difficulty connecting fully with the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nThis class will be a combination of lecture, group shares, and interactive exercises.",

Want teeth?\r\n\t* What about deep throat?\r\n\r\nHere's your chance to make your requests - and pet peeves - heard!\r\n\r\nThis is a participatory event open to couples of any combination, so long as one of them has some phallic protuberance and the other is applying lips, tongue, and maybe even throat to it.

While there's some jargon in the notes below that our wannabe’s might not understand, we assume the Toastmasters folks will get it. And you will soon! Note:\r\nBring your TI Magazine and we’ll take pics over at the Man! If you’re a Toastmaster and couldn’t be in Washington, DC, for their August International Convention, then bring your CC/CL/other manuals you’d like to advance in, and join us (with friends) for a real Toastmasters meeting - and some photos! We plan to cram in speeches, evaluations, and table topics into a one hour session, or more if demand exists for it, so on time is a good thing. Prompt arrivals will have the best chances for the most fun and credit.\r\nLooking to join in? Pepperland theme camp, Tuesday, 1-2PM.  Email: Gerflash (at) socal (dot) rr (dot) com. so we can plan ahead and count you in.\r\nJust maybe - the pix we take might make it into the TI Magazine! You’ll actually be Toastmastering on-Playa!",

Wear whatever you love best while running – whether that’s a tutu, sports bra and tights, or nothing at all.\r\n\r\nWhere: Black Rock City (Nevada – exact location info here)\r\n\r\nWhen: Tuesday, August 30th, 2016, 5 a.m.\r\n\r\nWho: You! Burners and ultrarunners of all types!\r\n\r\nWhy: Because it’s fun. Because it’s insane. Because it’s the ultimate high. Because you want to challenge yourself. Because we are working on really rad finishers’ presents! Because the race is a party! Because you don’t mind people chasing after you with bottles of whiskey while you run!\r\n\r\nWhat else: Pink Lightning Camp will be the race headquarters, start, finish, and aid station. Stop by to view the big map, results, ask questions, use our foam rollers and running sticks, or just hang out with some friendly folks. During the race, we’ll have cocktails, fun, music, and lots of cheering. Have your friends come to the healthiest party on the playa! Come on by to volunteer, hang out, pace, or run!",

    "description": "There are more than 50 million innocent displaced people that had to flee for war, poverty, injustice or climate change. The average stay of a refugee in a camp is 17 years. Since WWII the hosting and management of a refugee community in such camps has not changed. Till the day of today refugee camps are harsh survival environments where people risk exploitation, are hopeless and rules of the strongest apply. \r\n\r\nAfter being involved in the epicenter of the refugee crisis on the Greek island of Lesvos I came to the knowledge that there is such a big difference to be made in this global issue if we would stop seeing refugees, victims of injustice. Instead we should approach them as individuals with talents, opportunities equal to our own standards and with the same needs. We should be aware that if we would invest in people that have lost everything this investment will be returned to us in gratefulness and willingness to contribute in their own succes. You get what you give...\r\n\r\nIn creating communities that thrive you should start with environments that inspire. On Lesbos, the epicenter of the refugee crisis in Europe last year, I witnessed the similarities in dynamics between hosting refugees on a refugee camp and hosting a crowd on a music festival. We believe many insights from the festival industry can be integrated to redefine a refugee camp from a Spartan fashionlike environment to an inspiring festivallike experience.\r\n\r\nAdding to the festival game innovative solutions/companies, educational programs and integration of the refugee community in the management and self-sustainability of their camp will create an environment of harmony and dignity that will be an example in how to change a global issue into an opportunity that can serve humanity on a global scale. \r\n\r\nJoin me in this quest to redefine the global concept of a refugee camp to a campUS.",

Wed, Sat: 2-4PM.\r\nCome learn from a professional cartoonist to practice this expressive and enjoyable skill.  All skill levels welcome; you do not need to have any prior training or experience.  Learn all the basic skills like character creation, layout, composition, perspective, and comedy writing.  Brush up on advanced techniques like human and animal figure drawing, proportion, and color.  We end with an improvisational art game using the cartooning skills we've learned.  Supplies provided, or bring your own.\r\n* Forged out of the eons of Deep Time and raw forces of Nature, a uniquely shaped and smoothed river stone awaits your unique curiosity in an ephemeral moment of creative exploration. We supply you with the stone, paint and guidance; you supply your awareness, vision, and imagination. Together on your planetary journeys, after 4.5 billion years you and the river stone meet. Silly or profound, the colors or imagery are all a part of the play on the Playa. Will your rock become a bug, a power object, a flower, or a psychedelic paisley? Experienced art teachers can help with color mixing, brush technique, and concept execution. Create a memory to keep or offer as a gift. Thurs: 3-5PM.",

A lingerie dance-party where we offer ice-cold Champagne and where DJ Yaz and our dusty brethren from Camp DeMentha will provide sensual deep-house beats under our six gorgeous chandeliers. Our friends from the Arabian Nights mutant vehicle will expand our party into the streets, connecting to our sound system and adding the flair of 1001 nights. The plush decor under our Dome is only matched in sensuality by the black lingerie adoring the skin of our Bacchanalian revelers. We will dance from dusk until the champagne runs dry and the Playa draws our Bacchants off into the sensual night.",

Each year, we shoot, develop and fix about one hundred photographs on the playa each Burning Man. he Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.",

    "event_id": 20587,
    "description": "Contact Improvisation is a meditative dance technique in which participants use points of physical contact to provide the starting point for exploration through movement. This contact can actually induce the production of a pair bonding hormone, called oxytocin, in the human brain, similar to how you feel when you hug or kiss a loved one. \r\n\r\nThrough the sensation of touch and dance, you can explore organic movement generated through and with, one-another, forming new bonds and strengthening old ones.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by a variety of musicians, this session will begin with some simple guiding prompts to help individuals become familiar with touching as well as giving/receiving weight. As the jam progresses individuals get to explore movement by listening and responding to their partner/partners through touch. There are no right or wrong answers and you do not need prior dance training to participate. \r\n\r\nThe central characteristic of Contact Improvisation is a focus on bodily awareness and physical reflexes rather than consciously controlled movements.  Much like meditation, Contact Improvisational Dance seeks to honor the present moment by guiding the dancers to surrender what is happening now. \r\n\r\n“One learns to recognize and differentiate subtle impulses in our movement choices and our partner's choices. We begin to decipher the cues that we give and receive which tell us when to lead or follow, when to go up, when to go down, where to touch, how to lift, when to slow down, and when to be still. In this form one learns to stay in integrity with each choice, never forcing, never rushing. When Body, Mind, and Spirit are united in their instinctive wisdom one finds ones-self at home in every moment expressing ones true nature.”     \r\n\r\n- Moti Zemelman",

There is no wrong way to do this.\r\n \r\n Open the door to your body to express the unimaginable. \r\n \r\n In the experience, you will be guided through a passage in which you find your own way of moving the body. I don’t ask anyone to move their body in a rhythm, nor engage bodies, nor expect that all the people do the same action. People don’t need to follow a pattern or imitate; it’s experiential, there is no wrong way to do this. I give directions based on trust in the body, and what it can manifest.

Maybe someone can move rapidly, maybe another can move slowly, or hardly at all — each one with their own development and course of action.\r\n \r\n This workshop focuses on the method of “The Unknown Theater” (El Teatro Desconocido) directed by Juan Carlos De Petre and developed over forty years by a group of people concentrated on exploration of subtle expression. The practice reveals knowledge; we start from the consciousness of not-knowing — ignorance is the beginning. This knowledge is experimental and creative; not intellectual, preconceived, acquired through repetition, or memory.

You may overrule, but there will be consequences, such as body shots.\r\n\r\nShare your hilarious or hair-raising stories of international travel.  We've been there and back again, have a billion of 'em.  Introduce yourself to the Captain and you might get to see the cockpit!\r\n\r\nThe party starts at sunset (around 7:40) and we'll be open at least an hour and a half.  Find us on Italic between 4 and 4:30.  In case we have to camp a block away, look for a sign with reflective tape indicating the vector for final approach.  BYOC.  See you there!",

The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality. You don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to it. The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. How? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory \"hooks\" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel \"right\". We will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process. After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group. We look forward to sharing your future day together. Dr.Feelgood",

    "description": "Let's have a heart felt community conversation to reflect on our actions. To examine how to work towards right relationship with cultural traditions that aren't of our personal ancestry. \r\n\r\n•  Adornments and Healing Arts? Rituals & Spiritual Practices? Permaculture & Herbal Medicine? By engaging openly with sacred cultural traditions, are we unknowingly re-colonizing and harming oppressed people and cultures? (Cultural Appropriation). \r\n\r\n•  Do we know the true history of these traditions and peoples? Are they being oppressed? Are we benefiting? What questions can we ask ourselves? What can we do? \r\n\r\n • What does it mean to decolonize ourselves and why is it important to talk about it? \r\n\r\n•  What hole are we seeking to fill? What is it about mainstream consumerist culture and our own histories of immigration, assimilation, and struggle that leave us seeking connection and wisdom from indigenous cultures?\r\n\r\nLet’s reflect deeply from a place of love. Let's ask ourselves and each other these questions. Let's learn from the many resources available and talk about these complex issues that affect us all. Isn't it our shared responsibility to move towards right relationship for peace and freedom for all beings. Let's have these conversations ongoing, on and off the playa. Would love to see you!",

The dome becomes an Ancient temple space. The men then stand in a circle offering unconditional love and healing to the community of women who gather in the center. The women come for healing their trust of the Masculine and to receive their love. This is a hands-off workshop. There is no touching except optional hugging at the end. \r\n\r\nWhen men show up and become the pure presence of their Divine Masculine nature and truly witness them, then women can relax into their loving Divine Feminine nature and fully become that love. As both polarities do this, we transmute cultural wounds in the collective feminine and masculine for all of humanity, co-creating a needed and beautiful new balance.",

We will teach you simple traditional hand working metal skills to cut, shape, and hammer aluminum into a sexy bikini bra and/or bottom. Decorate with bits of jewelry to personalize yours. Tie with leather thong for a secure fit.  \r\nThese are the same metal shaping skills that craftspersons used in Da Vinci’s time to create beautiful works of art. Wear and share yours here at Burning Man! Allow about 2 hours for completion. Come early- limited supplies. Feel free to bring any small or broken baubles, earrings, etc.  to donate or help decorate bikinis with. \r\n\r\nYour partner can come watch, but this is primarily  a workshop  to empower women to learn to use simple hand tools to release their inner creativity. Costumes like this cost $$$ when purchased.  Make it as sexy as you dare. Yours is free to keep, and you'll be proud to wear it! Since each piece is custom formed for you, it will fit perfectly- large or small. And yes, it is cool, light and comfortable- even on the playa.\r\n\r\n(As an added bonus, \"Sunny\" our resident body painter will also be on hand to offer body decoration if anyone who wants to wear even less!)",

Will death be the end of life? The pain experienced in the lead-up to death or the manner death is portrayed may have lasting impressions on how we determine our own death. If death is a passage and a natural step, like a leaf that falls and disintegrates into the earth, how do we best prepare to be ready, at a moments notice to fall onto earth, without a shred of remorse, guilt or unpacked potential? This workshop is about giving yourself a chance to look deeper into death with a clean slate. Determine your own method to prepare for death and live life with an openness to dying. The heart-opening exercises are done alone, and with the group using resonance tuning, energy-centering and creative visualisation. Raise your consciousness!  with Tia Kansara",

This year, in name of \"Radical Self Expression\" we sent out five hundred vinyl toy elephants to kids all over the world and asked them to express themselves by decorating them.  We are then taking those elephants and displaying them at Burning Man under The Man as part of the Guild Workshops piazza.\r\nOur aim is to bring awareness of the importance of creativity in a child's life. Lack of funding has stopped art programs in many public schools across the country. We are figuratively and literally putting the crayon back in the child's hand. We are also bringing 10,000 elephants to the playa this year and letting burners express themselves by decorating the elephants, and gifting them to fellow burners. \r\nWe chose to create a vinyl elephant for the kids to decorate because of the elephant's outstanding memory. We are building positive experiences in children that we want them to remember for a lifetime. \r\nWe also sculpted the elephant into the shape of the Vitruvian Man, as a wink to this year's Burning Man theme.",

Utilizing the core tools of Tantra: Breath, Sound, Movement and Touch we are slowing down, and we are being together just as we are. As we slow down and link up breath and sound we create all these exquisite feedback loops- body to body, belly to belly, heart to heart, and we invite each other into more and more presence, trust and relaxation.\r\n\r\nEmbodied Intimacy guides everyone gently from a state of separation and isolation towards safety and oxytocin fueled connection. The result is a simple felt presence, real time intimacy and heartfelt shared truth. The story and drama of the mind subsides and a new level of being is found in its place. In-To-Me-I-See. Sound by Sound, sigh by sigh, breath by breath it all unfolds, melts and unwinds. At the speed of love we learn how to live from the wisdom of our heart instead of the worry of our minds.\r\n\"",

You can also ignite passion, dissolve shame, manage PTSD, or dive into even more elaborate erotic exploration.  It is possible to shape shift, time travel, change your age or status, safely feel fire, and even go against the laws of physics. Are you Captain F*cking America, a pink purring sexy kitten, or galavanting in Medieval times wielding your sword while riding a Pegasus? Yes! Anything is possible here!\r\nThrough Hypnosis we can travel far out into imaginary places, safely remove emotional blockages, as well as shift negative patterns and limiting beliefs that prevent our clients from having the intimate lives that they crave.\r\n*Learn how and why Hypnosis is so effective in exploring kink, sensation play and more\r\n*Learn history & practical uses for Hypnosis\r\n*Learn how the mind sabotages the best goals and desires \r\n*Get a small taste of what Hypnosis is like and let’s meet come face to face with your inner most juicy and alive sensual self! \"",

    "description": "Use the power of platonic (non-sexual) touch to transmute sexual energy into spiritual power – Pure Love.\r\n\r\n\"When yin and yang (or masculine and feminine) come together, it produces energy. Often, that energy is sexually directed. Combustion happens, but usually from the loins. This is part of our “animal / darwinian” nature. Nothing wrong with it per se – it is part of who we are. It is how the human race continues. \r\n \r\n And, we are more.\r\n \r\n This powerful energy can also be directed up and through the heart. And when it is, that force of energy has the power to soften the heart and break through walls we may have built up around it (fear, resentment, grudges, and other things that keep us from feeling our own Divinity). If the heart is open and cleansed, energy can move into that space. When it does, it creates a pleasure that makes sex seem rather mundane. The energy gets transmuted into spiritual power and ecstasy – Pure Love.\r\n \r\n In this workshop, we will use the power of yin and yang, platonic (non-sexual) touch and loving friendship to soften, expand and ignite the heart with Pure Love.\r\n \r\n Using the Light of our eyes and the Energy that moves through our hands and hearts we will connect with each other, swim in Love and glorify the Divinity within our hearts.\"",

Though gentle, relaxing, non-impactful movement sequences along with inspirational meditation, you will leave the day standing straighter and taller and with your shoulders falling back behind your chest, hence allowing you to lead with your heart as you walk forward into the world.\r\n \r\n Think of Feldenkrais as meditation with movement! \r\n \r\n If you are experiencing any pain, you might find it improve or resolve throughout the class. Feldenkrais helps with the realignment of our bones, muscles and joints and with the coordination of our overall movement patterns.\r\n \r\n As we radiate more love out into the world, the world can’t help but smile back.

    "description": "\"The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a new name for a concept deeply embedded in human nature: that by choosing to do something we're going to miss out on something else that is even better.  In cognitive psychology FOMO is known as loss aversion.  Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Most studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.  Basically FOMO is the losing out on what others are currently experiencing and valuing it higher than the gain of your current experience.  An early example of FOMO comes from Tulipmania in Holland in the 1590s.  Seeing and hearing others buy into the promises of tulip profitability encouraged others to do the same. Nobody wanted to be the one missing out. \r\n\r\nWhen you lose something it hurts and often to avoid this negative emotion strange behavior may occur. This talk will give insight into why FOMO occurs and illustrate that it happens not only to Millennials anxious about what experiences their peers are having, but also to those making business and investment decisions.",

This year’s dust shall be comprised of marble, sandstone, oak, and pewter, a highly controversial mixture never before introduced to the Black Rock desert. Because they don’t mess around when it comes to preserving intact the native chemical profile of the immediate environment of the Black Rock desert, the Bureau of Land Management has mandated extra precautions for 2016. As such, the BLM has required that BMOrg retain the services of the French Maid Brigade. It’s nothing we wouldn’t be doing anyway. \r\n\r\nRendezvous with us! You too can be one of the sexiest clean freaks on the playa—please bring: feather dusters, rags, dustbusters, service carts, vacuums, white gloves, latex gloves, enema kits, lube, and any other useful cleaning equipment. Join us in uniform with your surly attitude and worst possible French accent.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday at 2:00 pm we meet at 3 O’Clock and Esplanade then dust our way through every filthy, nasty camp on our march toward that dust bucket known as Center Camp Café, liberate them from their dusty oppression, and celebrate our triumph!",

The primary workshop/classroom includes seating and work tables where visitors will learn about the Lost Triangle and make a Lost Triangle template to take with them. Visitors also will have the opportunity to learn more about geometry by assembling small scale models.\r\n\r\nThere will be a dome with built in seats and a transparent skin being used for 24/7 multi-media presentations, and the Gypsy Wagon and car “SV 3 Rose” all made in plywood with integral slotted and notched connections, more whimsical creations as if from the mind of Leonardo.",

Industrial hemp fibre crops harvest high volumes of carbon very quickly, so farming and building hemp housing is a very effective way to store carbon - each build locks up tonnes of it. The buildings are also thermally effective so you have reduced operational energy costs. The broad opportunities for value adding to fibre crops mean that wherever communities work together with farmers, they can potentially create major positive change.",

From noon until sunset, our trained chefs serve up the freshest breakfast burritos on the Playa, accompanied by professionally made craft cocktails. Our collection of international DJs spin smooth beats until nightfall.\r\n\r\nWe also give revelers a chance to clean up with our Soul Power Showers; guests experience the rebirth and rejuvenation of cool, cleansing water sprayed forcefully from our pressurized washer system (imagine a water saving car wash inside our shower areas for guests). Baptised anew, heroes set out on their way spreading positive vibes.\r\n\r\nOn it's 11th Annual Celebration of the Soul Brunch, we were gifted curated sounds from Marques Wyatt, Paul Geddes, Deep Wood, Rafael de la Cruz, David Kiss, Big Daddy & more!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.amplfy.me/video/oQDJKzBew",

We want to empower and encourage our campers and visitors to continually offer these same three tokens of human contact through out BlackRock City and on our travels all over the world. \r\nWe will have paints and card stock so anyone who wants one has a chance to paint their own sign to offer hugs, gazing and listening. \r\nWe'll have other spontaneous events so check our sign!

Reaching out into every direction of your universe and expanding consciousness with the breath, we can reactivate the energetic body together. \r\n \r\n We'll be delving into how to realign the spine, our antenna to unity consciousness using acro yoga paired with kundalini energetic healing. The physical body is the intermediary for every dimension of our existence. By arousing kundalini energy the practitioner can activate third eye so that the distortions may be witnessed as they are released.\r\n \r\n We are our own best healer.

We will begin with a mantra followed by basic warm ups to open up the energy channels in our bodies before we get into the main kriya. The purpose of the kriya we will be performing is to harmonize the masculine and feminine polarity within the body which will result in the experience of a more wholesome, integrated and balanced sense of self. \r\n\r\n \r\nInstructor: Joel Mueller. Joel is an artist and musician with a deep interest in the spiritual and philosophical traditions of this world. For the past 7 years he has practiced a form of yoga called Kundalini tantra through the guidance of his partner Adriane. She learned this method from Yogi Bhajan and has been teaching it for over 15 years.",

Here’s your chance to experience something we guarantee you’ve never felt before! Eros Tangeré is a one-on-one “tactile performance” that can only be described as a sensation experience that is created as your very body is played as if it were an ever changing organic musical instrument.  Your body becomes the surface upon which amazing erotic sensations will cascade with the undulations of an amazing music track and scent. Imagine that you can FEEL the expression of music with your body. Shed of your clothes, you lay prone and robbed of your sense of sight, one of our artists will perform upon your body with the music in ways that you have never experienced. This is a unique and creative custom designed sensory performance. Not for the faint of heart. Eros Tangeré is a one on one, sensual adult event. Space is very limited so signing up for a session prior to start time is highly recommended. Check in at the Camp for Sensual Pleasures inside Spanky’s Wine Bar for more info and times. 18+, Ladies Only. This has become a hit-favorite at Burning Man, do not miss it.

Our two “Maestros” will teach essential dance moves for each style… while enforcing the Latin proverb: Nobody cares how you dance, just do it with passion!

Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through group laughter. It’s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. “Inappropriate” Laughter Yoga is also a possibility, if our clientele are okay with it. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits. Find much more info online by searching on Laughter Yoga, but come! Enjoy!",

    "description": "In order to live in a world without war we must first heal the war between the sexes. It is time for feminine power and leadership to rise and join a healthy, incorruptible masculine. Where are the positive archetypes of feminine power? Kali, who cuts off your head? Hera, who is the god form of holly homemaker: basically “Zeus’ wife” with a goddess-sized jealous streak? Wonder Woman, who battles evil but has no family and no love in her life? It’s time for us to tell a new story of femininity, with our choices, with our self-expression, and with our lives. There are too few positive examples of women who are in full command of their sexuality and its attractive powers. There are too few healthy stories of women who’s full creative expression is unbridled and uncontrolled. There are too few healthy stories of men who are powerful without creating harm and violence .  There are too few healthy stories of men who create win-win instead of win-lose.  Learn how to harness the feminine forms and masculine forms of power in each of your interactions and become a true manifestor - brining your highest vision into reality through your being, your words, and your actions.You will learn an unforgettable map of your own sources of power, some of which have been lying dormant for your entire life. Once you can locate and allow all four faces of incorruptible power to move through you, you can lead, inspire, and serve almost anyone. For Men and Women who want to bring their full spiritual presence into the material world and be the bridge between our present reality and the future vision only you can see.",

Our Guild artisans help you pose while laying on a green screen (with or without clothing), take two pictures, process those pictures, display the final images (one with wings), and encourage you to download it to your camera or thumb drive.  We can also send you an image via email after the event.  Have fun with your images, which are suitable for printing, social media distribution, or decorating your computer, phone or watch.\r\n\r\nIn short, you haven’t done Burning Man 2016 until you have a picture of yourself as The Vitruvian Me!",

If this sound like something you will enjoy (or would be a great opportunity to step outside your comfort zone) sign up to the Lip-sync Battle 2016.\r\nSpace is limited, so register early at Camp Anita! Bring your song on an USB or MP3 player. Ask for Tim or Verity!\r\nFor some inspiration watch the teaser video from PapaZahns (Camp Anita’s Sister Camp) at this years Blazing Swan (Western Australian Regional Burn) in the URL link provided.",

Bring your water or hydration liquid. We’ll provide sticks for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese. He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain health through LSA, and vowed if he was ever freed, he’d dedicate his life to spread its benefits, with the proviso that no trainer could ever charge for it. (Like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, moved to Southern California, and taught classes of students and future teachers. Today, weekly classes abound in So Cal, around the US, and the world.

    "description": "Do you like Burning Man?  Do you like shiny lights?  Do you like play-doh?  We thought so.  This year, the NY Regional is combining all three, for the ultimate Midway interactive art trifecta at Burning Man.  \r\n\r\nEach visitor to the Mad Sorcerer's Workshop creates one tiny clay creature and adds it to the world growing on the shelves of an infinity box.  Visitors are encouraged to interact with each other, to cooperate, and to let their imaginations roam, molding polka dot trees, green cows, castles, dinosaurs, and UFOs.  Make a blue fish, your friend can make a red bird, the next person will make a small man, together we'll have the beginnings of a whole new world, with the reflections of the infinity box making it look like there's whole schools and flocks of strange creatures and a crowd of people, all interacting.\r\n\r\nYou get to be the Mad Sorcerer, create whole worlds in your crystal ball, just to mess with them.  You get to say how creative and lovely your pet world will be.  There's no skill required, no creation too boring or too creative.  A red, and yellow and purple castle?  Yes!  A small brown snake?  Yes!  Every play-doh creature has a place with us.\r\n\r\nWant to see how the project is going?  Want to Contribute and Volunteer? Like us at https://www.facebook.com/Mad-Sorcerer-1698581610391522/ for project updates and event announcements. \r\n\r\nOpen 24-7, for kids of all ages, shade, play-doh and infinity box worlds provided.",

Utilizing our physiology and breath we will be co-creating a Merkabah Light Body Activation.\r\nMerkabah activation is a 3000 years old breathing technique that allows to open a portal in our heart chakra. This will bring us to feel the vibrations and the energy of the universe. The intensity of the technique depends on the person, ranging from an incredible feeling of ecstasy, until space and time journeys. Being a technique that connects with the inner and higher self, it will also allows to experience breakthroughs, get answers about our lives, solve problems that we didn't even know to have. The more open to receive love and the more open minded we will be, the more we will get from this practice. The technique is as powerful as magical. Almost everybody that have experienced it, described it as mind blowing, many as life changing, some others as the most powerful moment of their life.\r\nPrepare to experience yourself in Totality!",

You can move being encouraged and guided by the intelligence of morphic fields (Rupert Sheldrake has published credible research about this). \r\n 　　 \r\nA morphic field is a field of energy that stores information; in the field exist dynamics, settings, games, processes; it is a memory field, it is an intelligent field. A morphic field is created when any of us introduces an intention and an action in space and time, which after being performed several times becomes a specific intelligence, then that intelligence influences the actions of a whole group and creates a memory of a way of doing things. In a morphic field the communication is easy and instantaneous. \r\n 　　 \r\nMorphic Field Movement becomes physical expression, borne from body languages, from the poetry of the body, from the clear expression of the bodies. \r\n 　　 \r\nWhat I would like to explore is the possibility to express more subtle dimensions of communication, more rare to our usual life; communicating realities that words can not name and the body can reveal. Morphic Field Movement is a proposal to create another type of communication — alternative now, and I hope definitive and more popular in the future.　　 #clothing optional #nudist #naturist",

To be naked in 21st century western society demands intense self-examination, the questioning and reappraisal of conventional conventions and morality. In this sense, naturism, as the cultural and political movement of nudism is often known, is an inherently philosophical practice. And what better way to do philosophy than naked? We’re sure your college seminars would have been much more fun nude. Come and join us for lively discussions, debates and story-telling. We’ll be discussing naturism, body image, sharing experiences, debating body modification, if and how laws should be changed – really everything related to the human body.",

To be naked in 21st century western society demands intense self-examination, the questioning and reappraisal of conventional conventions and morality. In this sense, naturism, as the cultural and political movement of nudism is often known, is an inherently philosophical practice. And what better way to do philosophy than naked? We’re sure your college seminars would have been much more fun nude. Come and join us for lively discussions, debates and story-telling. We’ll be discussing naturism, body image, sharing experiences, debating body modification, if and how laws should be changed – really everything related to the human body.",

    "description": "Playfully Yours is now a Village with 4 camps. Playfully Yours Dungeon is a play space for you to learn and experience sensation play in our well-equipped dungeon. We encourage beginners, intermediates and those curious about BDSM play to come, learn, and experience in a safe, non-pressured, and supervised environment. As our name implies (Playfully Yours), we focus on the lighter, softer, and more sensual side of BDSM. Our personnel are available to provide instructions and demonstrations on the safe use of the equipment and will supervise play or can help facilitate play.  We’ll also have an outdoor dungeon play area equipped with a double St Andrews Cross, spanking bench, and stock. We also have a lounge area where you can relax and meet our campmates if you are over 21 years old with id. The lounge has a spanking bike, a corn hole bean bag game, lounge chairs, a mini bar serving cherry bombs, and a spinning wheel to facilitate participation. In Mist’R Cool’s Camp you can have the Cool Mist Experience with a fully automated misting booth, try to put together oversized 3D and 2D puzzles, show off with a 10’ dance pole, and experience the Cool Massage with a new and advanced sensual massager. Come for a private intimate portrait session in Bare Naked Tramps Portrait Studio. Individuals, couples, and groups are all welcome. Relax and enjoy great company in the exquisitely decorated Marshmallow Lounge. There will be libations for your pleasure and theme nights get dressed up for such a James Bond 007 party. Check other listings as we also offer daily classes and events.",

The result is said to be therapeutic, rather than sexual. The “stroking” activates the limbic system and releases a flood of oxytocin. The technique was originally billed as a spiritual-style practice like meditation, but as it gains popularity, it’s being presented as more of a “technological innovation” or “body-hack to happiness.” The “guru” of the technique, 46-year-old Nicole Daedone, guarantees that it’s profound whether you’re coupled or single.   This course will be strictly women and transfolks so that everyone can experience the electricity on both sides of the position.",

    "description": "We will have 10 pre-stretched and heavy duty canvases that are 3'x4' tiled together to create a 30' x4' artists playground. We will supply all water based acrylic paints in an array of colors. We will supply all brushes and artist knives. We will have palate mixing available as well as ample water and rags to assist you in color changes. We will maintain the entegraty of this project and make sure there is everything you need to get lost in your own world of art expression. We will have satellite radio for your listening pleasure and will keep the wall lit for several hours at night too! And the end of the event we will disassemble the wall and randomly distribute the finished canvases. These rare gifts will each hold the work of hundreds of passing artists who will have combined to create the memory of BRC 2016!!!\r\nAND...while you are there and if you dare, Thomas delFuego will let you choose a Rune from his pile of hand painted Runes. These stones on 10,000 year old sand concretions and will speak to your heart and that very moment:):):) Come join Thomas and Darma delFuego and become our friends for life!",

You must be 21 or over to Party here and we do ask for and check ID's (it's always good to carry your ID while at Burning Man). We start to dispense our \"Tiki Punch\" (yes, it has a punch) at 11:00am daily. Nudity is never required but at Party Naked Tiki Bar it is rewarded. This year we have 800 commemorative leis to give to citizens that \"do it\" (get naked). Make sure to come by early and get lei'd. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Nude is not lewd so uninvited or inappropriate touching is prohibited. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day. Be LNT friendly and bring your own cup please.",

Pinhole Project has brought to the playa twelve very large pinhole cameras created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. Join us in our annual pilgrimage to use old school pinhole photography on the playa.\r\n\r\nThe Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.",

We maintain a full wet black and white photographic darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs. Photographs made of paper with traditional chemicals and no digital input. The Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.",

Well come on down to Recycle Camp and SHOW US YOUR CANS!!!  At Recycle Camp we want all of your ALUMINUM cans as part of our gift to the playa. We are located at 6 and Center Circle behind the Center Camp Cafe and will be open every day until 5pm. No drop offs allowed, when you get there you will help us quickly separate your cans before riding the Crushinator, our magical bicycle-powered can crushing apparatus, to compact the cans so we can store as many as possible before scrapping the aluminum off-site. All of the money we generate from can recycling is donated to the Gerlach school system. We only accept aluminum cans so please keep all of your soup or heavy metal cans. If you are unsure if it is aluminum a good rule of thumb is if you can't crush it, then we don't want it. Also, some stout beers like Guinness also have a plastic widget that cannot be recycled with the aluminum, please remove of be conscious of it before bringing them to us. PROTIP from the Recyclenauts: bring a MESH bag to store all of your cans in. Plastic bags won't allow your cans to dry out, so please store them in a mesh bag before bringing them over to Recycle Camp and help make things a little less juicy for us when we crush them. Be smart, plan ahead, Recycle Camp wants YOU to come CRUSH it with us!!! We are CLOSED ON MONDAY, plan ahead!",

Daily and nightly, when the live music is playing, come share your artistic expression by painting upon our mural canvas wall.  Portions of Reverbia's Art Wall Mural will be painting between established lines, while other areas of the Art Wall Mural will be free formed expression.  *Note that the Reverbia Art Wall Mural will not be open 24 hours…but will operate throughout the day and night whenever our artist supervision  is available.  During Reverbia's concerts in the Shade Series and Reverbia Live Nights…the Art Wall Mural will be the most consistently available for public painting and expression.",

The goal of this meditation is to practice the art of witnessing rather than reaching to situations and circumstances. Be aware and remember that since you are alive, you must not take your life for granted. Choose the position: 'I will always value my life.' Appreciating my life means waking up every morning and looking into the mirror, and saying to myself, 'I am so happy to be alive!' Thank you Osho, for helping me to create this meditation.\" I designed this meditation so that it can be done in a group or by yourself. The first six stages are an oppertunity to practice dying consciously, a rehearsal for the end of your life. The remaining four stages are a reminder to live totally and cherish each moment.",

    "description": "A True Reflections Palace - showcasing mirrors that do not reverse left and right!\r\n\r\nCome see the sparkle in your eyes from the light in your soul.  These mirrors reflect you as you are, not reversed, and are truly magical!  \r\n\r\nTheres both science and an art here - your face \"works\" when you see it as it truly is.  In contrast it stops working, and you tend to stare at yourself in mirrors. Then get self-critical all too often. Even if you are feeling wonderful, like all so many times at Burning Man, a mirror doesn't reflect it naturally, so you tend to lose that sparkle and start to question your good feelings.  \r\n\r\nIn contrast, when you look in one of these true reflection mirrors, your face keeps working!  Your eyes, which have so much beautiful information in them, continue to have that same information that you can see.  This is what we see and read so well when we look at you.  That sparkle when you are happy, that depth when you are being deep, that vitality and genuineness that we know about you, now you can see it too!  So easy to believe in yourself when you see all that true energy you have. \r\n\r\nThe result?  Expect to be absolutely floored.  You are an amazing creature - a Human Being, and now you can see what that really looks, and feels like.  The feedback loop you find yourself in now is clear and complete, so smiles look like real smiles and you will smile back.  Complete with sparkle!!! Beautiful!\r\n\r\nThere's lots of posters in the Palace (which is made from giant tinker style toys) to explain it all.  If you don't see the magic, ask one of us for a demo and explanation. .. we want to get you to your own AHA moment!   \r\n\r\nNote-this is the same Palace that has been under the Man, on Playa, on Esplanade and in Center Camp!  Don't Miss It - Its Magic!",

Many of us have engaged in sensual touch with a lover or tickling at a young age, but are you aware of how well the two can work together to make an amazing sensory experience with someone? Whether it is tickling to tears, to moans of delight, or simply squirming Kelli Lynn Sage (Domme Sage) is well versed in this and will be leading this class in sensual touch and the art of tickling with a partner. Domme Sage has learned the ropes over the years and wants to pass her wisdom on to you. She will instruct you, with the help of her assistants and volunteers, on the art of tickling and sensual touch. This event is for those 18 years old and over (please bring your ID if you look young). We may be requesting volunteers from the audience for some aspects of the class, so if you are eager to be part of this hands on experience let us know. People of all gender identities are welcome to attend. It is best if you can come with a partner so you can practice some of what you learn, if you come alone we cannot guarantee to partner you up with someone. We recommend bringing a towel or something similar to lay on the ground to sit on. In addition we ask that you be respectful of all participants and remind you to ask before touching someone that you have not made arrangements before hand.",

    "description": "Now is the time to wake up to our ability to heal ourselves, to be the guru, healer, and being of light that we are are and choose to express that in our current reality. As we heal our nervous system of the trauma and pain accumulated from the experience of learning in our human bodies, we create a space for expansion and connection. We summon you all to hear the call within you, stand in courage, and bravely face down your pain and trauma and emerge whole and fully expressed as an innocent, fearless, loving, joyous being. We recognize that it is important to be respectful of indigenous cultures and practices when using the term \"Shaman\". The Ceremony leaders do not consider themselves to be Shamans, yet we find it is the best way to describe the ritual being used in this healing ceremony so we feel good about using this term to describe the practice, not the leaders. Shamanism is the practice of inducing trance in order to achieve a state of non-ordinary reality in order to communicate with the source energy that flows through all of life, healing spirits, animal spirit guides, angels, and ancestors. This practice also calls upon the elemental forces for cleansing and healing of mind, body, and spirit. Pranic Journeying takes us into a place of non-ordinary reality where deep release of mental, emotional, and physical blocks may occur. In this state we are open to receive deep esoteric truths, connect with our helping spirits and ancestors, and merge with our higher self and higher consciousness. The journey is unique based on the individual although the group undergoes a unique journey together as well. Each journey can be very different as the healing intelligence of spirit knows just where to take us to safely clear the energy in alignment with our intentions. There are many ways to induce a shamanic trance: drumming, dancing, singing, ingesting plant medicine and breath work. In this course we are using a form of breath work we call “Healing Breath” which is s",

It is an open-eye meditation technique that focuses on the breath while also taking in your surroundings. The walking meditation focuses on the sensation your feet feel while walking at a slow place in a small circle. This practice helps form a connection with the earth as a sense of grounding. With practice, this technique helps one discover who they really are, not who they feel they are supposed to be. It has done wonders for me and truly changed my life.

Promoting eye-opening (and leg-opening) dialogue on the many different forms of this tucked away treasure. We're talking innies, outties, bald vulvas, hairy vulvas, groomed vulvas, asymmetrical vulvas, layered vulvas, big vulvas, small vulvas . . . just like a fingerprint no two can ever be the same! The assortment really is amazing.\r\n\r\nInspired by Australian artist Greg Taylor's exhibition entitled The Great Wall Of Gina displaying 151 life size porcelain sculptures along a 130ft wall at the MONA in Hobart, Australia. In the gift shop of the museum they sell soaps that are a replica of these moulds, but on Playa we will be the artists! \r\n\r\nWho will be your muse?",

Through the combination of exploring the symbols, archetypes, metaphors that show up in the one of a kind story created in our time together, you are provided context and tools to explore the power and potential of your story and how to use it to access and embody the parts of you that may be lying dormant. People have requested stories that will heal, provide insight about their gifts, and help them access their personal power. \r\n\r\nWhat to expect from A Soul Story Circle: When we gather in a circle, one person is chosen to receive a story that will serve all. We then go through a process called talking back to the story, where we make sense of the symbols, metaphors, and archytpes that presented and how they apply to our every day lives.",

Jimmy and the Guild are masters of turning parts from the Golden Age of American manufacturing into beautiful assemblages.\r\nAudience artist participants thru the week who experience the ADA's booth can put in their name for a lottery to be drawn at 6:30 on Thursdays evening, to be one on 10 chosen artists for this special event. The 10 artists will get a blank board to work on, will choose their own subject matter for the art, and show it to Jimmy at the start of the build. Imagine speed chess!!! where Jimmy will take their suggestion, lay out a few pieces to start and instruct the artist to apply what he did, and as Jimmy works around to the other artists, they add their own vision until Jimmy comes back around, to compound the vision! All other Guild members will help with instruction, tools, and raw materials in this frantic 2 hour filmed creation of 10 unique works of art, finishing with flair and fire into the darkness! As with all created art during the week, the artists rule what happens when done... keep, showcase, give away, burn, gift it...",

The crew is busy, still setting up. Then, three more musicians and two back-up singers join the band. Everybody sings, plays, harmonizes, dances, and runs. They change instruments and clothes. Bryne appears in the Big Suit. The backdrop is often black, but sometimes it displays words, images, or children's drawings. The band cooks for 18 songs, the lyrics are clear, the house rocks. In this concert film, the Talking Heads hardly talk, don't stop, and always make sense.\" (thanks IMDB!)",

    "description": "You are invited to a special pairing of heart opening practices which invite us to allow more love to flow in, around and through us.\r\n \r\n First we enjoy a Tantric Chakra opening Dance where we will feel our place between heaven and Earth through sacred embodied expression\r\n \r\n Then in the state of connected bliss Fia will lead us in a heart song circle!\r\n \r\n Singing together gives us the space to clear out our energetic field, raise our vibrations and let go of what is no longer serving us. Through singing we can develop deep contact with ourselves, it opens the heart and silence the mind. It connects us with each other and is a way of being present in the now. \r\n \r\n About Fia:\r\n Fia Forsström is a singer-/songwriter from Sweden who creates music with a wish to move something inside of you. Lyrics that reflects all of life; here is the beautiful and wild, but also the ugly and uncomfortable. She is driven by evoking thoughts and to inspire. She has a great passion for the healing power of singing and creating spaces where people can meet each other just as they are. After experiencing the enormous joy and energy of chanting circles, singing together without any focus on achievement and instead let the song come from the heart, she wants to open up and invite more people to share that magic.\r\n \r\n https://www.facebook.com/FiasMusic/",

Feel the vibrations of this tangible Earth we live in knowing that everything is in motion and nothing rests. Tantra is a system so intuitive and natural to human kind that its essence can be seen within all spiritual paths from the Celtic, African, Native American, Sufi, esoteric Christian, Hindu, Sound Healing, Kabbalah, Buddhist, and Taoist wisdom traditions. It is a set of spiritual practices and ritualistic actions that through personal effort and experimentation are designed to direct universal energies of the macrocosm into the practitioner to achieve total liberation from ignorance and suffering. In this workshop we will use a myriad of psycho-physical exercises learned from different traditions for modifying and exploring consciousness.

In the hands of the artist, the box becomes a sculptural form. Inside and outside, the sculptural box is a container for place, memory, and emotion. This talk will provide a survey of how artists have successfully used boxes to create art and inspire attendees to create their own boxes fueled by their experiences in Black Rock City. \r\n \r\nSpeaker: Shimmera. Shimmera (aka Cheryl Patrice Derricotte in the default world) is a visual artist and her primary medium is glass. This is her 3rd trip home to Black Rock City and she is the guest visual arts instructor for the three-credit California Institute of Integral Studies’ class “Art and Survival: Radical Creation at Burning Man.",

In this talk, a leading evolutionary psychology professor (author of 'The Mating Mind', 'Spent', and 'Mate') will give a quick, fun overview of the new science behind poly. Then we'll have a Q&A.",

When those same concepts are applied to social interaction, AMAZING things come in to existence.   The Game has a simple premise; Draw a card from the deck and the player does what is written. “The Game” has a tendency to create possibilities where there were once boundaries. Choices where there were once obstacles. “The Game”: the love child of truth or dare, charades, post office, twister, spin the bottle, and \"American's Got talent\".. “The Game” is perfect for letting one's imagination out to play. Watch what happens when permission is given to create, with wanton abandon. “The Game” is both a game of chance and skill if you want to believe that.  Remove a self-limiting perspective, gain new insights in creative problem solving.  Come play 'The Game'",

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

'Tis the blood of a strong voice. \r\nIt is not always the most appealing sound, especially for beginners, but sometimes you need to sound ugly before sounding awesome! \r\nThe krackle is the rubbing together of the vocal chords, which gives you immense breath control, builds range, and give the sound extra resonance and brilliance. The krackle will get your voice anywhere you want it to take you. Once your voice has worked through the krackle, then it is ready to be garnished with other beauties, like breathy and flowy goodness. But for now were krackling it up!",

Not in a judgmental way... This is meant in a good way. The very basic definition transphobia, is simply being frightened of trans-folks because of misunderstandings or lack of education on all things trans. This is often because the questions you’ve always wanted to ask, are taboo; making it difficult to learn, understand, and honor the transgender path.\r\n\r\nTrans 101: The Nuts and Bolts.\r\nA brief PowerPoint discussion of definitions and the basics of gender, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. How are transgender and cisgender people alike? How are they different?\r\n\r\nTrans 201: A Peak Through the Veil.\r\nAfter learning the basics, we’ll have a Q&A session where any and all questions will be fielded. We all know that there are questions that are deemed inappropriate to ask a transperson. For this brief moment in time, there are no taboos. We will do our best to answer your questions with honesty, transparency, and sincerity.\r\n\r\nTrans 301: Dropping the Veil.\r\nWe will bare our souls and our bodies for visual inspection and further Q&A.\r\n\r\nTrans 401: Shredding the Veil.\r\nFor those brave audience members, we will open ourselves to not only visual review, but hands on, or hands in, examination.",

Come learn how fear and our essential state of being work in a dynamic relationship to create our EGO (impulsive actions, and self-defeating beliefs and habits). In this workshop, we will touch on the basic understanding of fear and it's differentiation from Worry, Anxiety, and False Fear. Then dive deep into existentialism explaining why fear has such a programmable hold on our free will, and biology, causing our impulsive actions and thoughts. Then we will explore techniques I've used to transcend my own fears, self-defeating beliefs and habits, freeing myself from years of insecurity, blame, resentment, childhood abuse, guilt from molestation, and general self-hate. I will share every method that has worked for me, and then afterword we will have a Q&A, and have a fun conversation and share our experiences. \r\n\r\nAbout Me: Hello my name is Nine Johnson, I'm a Performance Anxiety coach in Los Angeles California. I usually work with Actors, Singers, Athletes, Directors and businesses people from all industries to identify and overcome their performance anxieties, insuring confidence and peak performance.

Watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osqSdVTIZ_4\r\n \r\n This is a \"station\" puja. There is an inner and outer circle. One rotates and with each rotation you have a new partner. Each partnering is an opportunity to fall in love with ourselves through the eyes of another.\r\n \r\n The stations are subtle, elegantly simple and this is their potency. The tantric arts invite us into our own heart in an ease full way. One of the most exquisite is this ceremony where we open to an embodied experience of witnessing the divine in all and thus the diving in ourselves.\r\n \r\n Open to the possibility of adoration, forgiveness, unconditional love and experiencing your true and higher self in the span of a few short hours.",

Learn how to never fear you're making the wrong choice because you know how to navigate your path by trusting what feels right in your body.\r\n \r\n Qoya is based on the idea that through movement we remember. We remember our essence is wise, wild and free. Wise, wild and free also draw reference to the movement forms we practice. Wise- calling on the wisdom traditions of yoga. Wild- the creative expression in dance. Free- expanding our capacity to enjoy our bodies through more feminine and flowing movement. In Qoya there is no way you can do it wrong, and the way you know you are doing it right is that it feels good.\"",

Let go this notion and.develop a proper psychological state of mind and begin to heal.\r\n\r\nThis approach to healing is based on the Eastern philosophy of synchronizing the body and the mind. Once we do that we can begin to truly heal from any emotional or physical issues we're dealing with. I've practiced a technique called a body scan which helps join body and mind. I'm curious to see how this would work in a group setting as this would be a new experience for me. After the body scan, I plan to start by asking everyone what they want to heal from and from there perhaps develop a common theme among the participants or just see what comes up and go with the energy in the dome.",

Afterwards we will scatter to share the spirit & purpose of this year's temple.\r\n\r\nIn perihelion to this event, some of us winged folk will gather again for a night-time circling of the temple, at midnight after the temple burn, around the ashes of the Temple.\r\n\r\nNote: The Temple Guardians enthusiastically anticipate this participation, and only ask that we be prepared for them to begin the soft-close of the temple around dawn on Sunday, followed by the firm closure by 8 AM. Parking bikes >500' away from the Temple is requested if you want to stay in the area past 8 AM.\r\n\r\nhttps://walkofthewings.wordpress.com/home",

Humans are social beings and enjoy others for the most part and listing to stories gives us that connection.  But what actually makes up a story?

These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion.

Even when we learn later in life that is good, we can still experience shame. Nothing is better for shame than confronting it. This workshop gives participants the opportunity to alternate roles as exhibitionist and voyeur in groups of three. The voyeurs job is to hold a sacred non-judgmental space for the exhibitionist. The exhibitionists job is to let go of shame and give themselves over to erotic pleasure, knowing they have permission and are supported by their voyeurs.",

Bonus points for being able to spin in place without losing your balance to transform into your alter ego. Women, do you need a little kinky revenge against men-kind? Learn about some safe and fun “painful practices” in a supportive, empowered environment. Men, pay homage to the superior sex from Paradise Island and have an opportunity to atone for the sins of men-kind by receiving punishments and participating in Amazon bondage games (confess your sins while tied in her golden lasso). Bring your favorite submissive of any gender but keep in mind this is a FEMDOM event, no male tops. Male switches must be in “sub mode.”",

So leave your $$ in your camp, and bring something fun to tip your bartender!!! Please bring a cup that you can pimp out while you wait. We do not operate on any schedule, so the rule of thumb is: If the barstools are down, we are most likely serving drinks, or at least attitude... Some of our games include: Pool, fooseball, tether ball, shuffleboard, white trash horseshoes, and we are excited to introduce nascar inspired drag racing!",

Prepare your mind and spirit for another uplifting day on the Playa!  Yogananda claimed the purpose of exercise was to awaken an inner energy source.  His series of energization exercises were designed to bring both energy and calm.  The exercises “purify the bloodstream and recharge every cell with cosmic energy.” The aim is to gain increased awareness and control over your life force and to identify more with the soul than the body.  This event happens just before yoga and meditation at Buddha Camp and is a great way to wake up and prepare your body and mind for those sessions.  All the exercises are done from a standing position and anyone, regardless of fitness level, can benefit.  Following the exercises we will repeat together, Yogananda's Peace and Harmony Prayer for World Peace.  This event is 30 minutes long.  Come join us!",
