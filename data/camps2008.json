This ain’t Sex in the City…it’s         a one-drink bar with a no-cup policy and alcohol so strong there’s no         need to wash that shotglass you just shared. “We got Whisky, we got Whores,         what else do you fuckin’ need?!!!” For the past 5 years we’ve been a major         meeting spot for the New York community and entertaining everyone else         who stops by along the way. We whores have been both fueling and escaping         the American Dream for years, so we’ve got our place on classic Main Street         USA. Politicians, preachers, pimps, performers…we don’t care. Give us         your passion and a loud YEE-HAW, and we’ll give you a shot on the stage.",
