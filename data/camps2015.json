    "description": "Have you ever wondered what happened to your childhood fairytale heroes after you left their lands? WICKEDLAND brings you face-to-face with them: all grown up, distorted and oh-so-very twisted. How have you changed? What fairytale archetypes do you still carry inside of you? We'll help you find out – come play, there are no spectators here!\r\n \r\nWICKEDLAND brings your favorite childhood fairytale heroes and their archetypal stories back to life. But something has changed – this world isn't nearly as innocent as it was when you were younger, because you are it.\r\n \r\nClimb up the castle towers that adorn the entrance to our camp. If you want to dig deeper through the world of twisted fairytales, you are welcome to sit with a book in our cozy lounge. But be warned – a transformation lingers behind every page you turn. If you're not careful, you may leave WICKEDLAND as Gay Donald Duck or Nymphomaniac Snow White.",

We took a lot of inspiration from the Book of Tea written in 1906 by Okakura Kakuzō of Japan in English, he addressed the growing concern of clash between the east and west cultures.

Our safe, open, meaningful and interactive environment plies you with mimosas, Harry Potter cocktails and good conversations to get you naked -- spiritually naked, that is. Share your aspirations on the Tree of Dreams. Unburden your woes on the Tree of Prayers. Take a quiet moment out of your day to pray or meditate. Align your mind and spirit with Mimosa Vinyasa (Wed 5-6PM BYOM). Connect to each other at our modern partner-dancing workshops in costume (Tutu Tuesday 4:30-6PM + Bunny Thursday 3-4:30PM)! Join us for our Harry Potter cocktail hour dressed in your favorite color of the rainbow (Friday 5-7PM BYOC, starting with Andy’s standup routine)! We dare you to come sit in the Bad Advice Chair. You may even find yourself in the middle of an impromptu flow jam or fire spinning session. Even if it’s something as simple as dancing to our live beats or relaxing in the shade of our visually stimulating Dome, we hope you leave the Naked Rainbow with the most vibrant hues of your soul revealed.",

Soft Landing sponsors and staffs the Full Circle Tea House which is planning to return to the playa for the 5th year to offer fine pu'erh tea and herbal infusions in the Chinese Gung Fu tradition. Servers provide tea and empathy and comfortable spaces for rest, hydration and quiet conversation 24 hours a day. The Full Circle Tea House will be hosting a satellite Zendo in our camp this year. The Zendo project is coordinated by volunteers organized and trained by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). Soft Landing also presents the Palenque Norte speaker series featuring 40 visionary talks and stories spanning concepts such as technology, medicine, art, science, design and entheobotany. These events take place in the Palenque Norte circus tent which also hosts small musical performances and yoga.",

Our response is that humans can discover their true nature through yoga and meditation. Self-discovery is a process of lighting up the mythic metaphor of the \"rainbow bridge.\" Anodea Judith writes that \"on our journey through life, the chakras are the wheels along this axis that take the vehicle of the Self along our evolutionary quest, across the Rainbow Bridge, to reclaim our divine nature once again...to restore the Rainbow Bridge is to reconnect to our own divinity, anchoring it in the world around us and healing the rifts that so plague our world.\"\r\n\r\nIn interacting with other burners, we would like to focus on 7 chakras over 7 days. We will offer a daily practice tied to each Chakra leading up to the lotus / crown / diamond chakra the day the man burns.",
