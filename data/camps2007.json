Your hosts again this year include Dr. Pyro, Frank the Vintner, Blowfish, Chickenbutt and his lovely wife Renee, Sunsetred, Garcia, Felony Arson, Buster, KJ, Gary, barB, Don, Tots, Shorty, Marta, David, Xander, Joe, Ferd, The Professor, Ron, Sue, Liam, Terry, Carly, and a whole host of characters better left unmentioned.

We are working to heighten the experience of the people in the village, streamlining village living to the ultimate.

The \"Green\" theme of the event this year has attracted an inordinate amount of hippies, flower-children, peaceniks and yoga instructors. This has disrupted the delicate balance of the cities population and could cause catastrophic failure of the Black Rock City egosystem in the years to come.In an attempt to counteract this imbalance GFY will be recruiting like minded agents to be sent on vital missions throughout the event, restoring causing chaos, mischief and mayhem thereby restoring balance to the egosystem of Black Rock City.Your city needs you…Are you up to the the task?… end of transmission …",

During the week of Burning Man we build and maintain a safe refuge where tackiness is not only tolerated but applauded and praised. Political correctness, simple common human dignity and voting rights are mocked and discouraged. World class Mai Tai’s poured by Spanky and floral lai’s are offered on Friday nite to ask for forgiveness for our wickedness. Competitive Limbo competitions are rumored to be slated for ESPN. Smore Whore will be making a triumphant return to the Playa and supplying her hot fresh Smores. Free form Island drumming is a staple diet and public humiliation will be found at the Limbo Queen’ feet. Juicy Yum Yum is said to be returning if enough eye glitter can be found.",

IF THY DOES NOT COVET THY TITTY, they will come 2 by 2,\" said the voice.Since 1999 I have gone to the Black Rock Desert with my dedicated tribe, because it takes a few dedicated people to build a City of Tittys. I have collected Titty prints using a special painting technique. I start first by preparing my painting surfaces by sanding and sealing 4 foot by eight foot pieces of plywood. I then paint the surfaces and frame them. These are my building blocks. I apply paint to the tittys and press them onto the boards transferring the prints onto them each titty soul then signs the prints, immortalizing them forever. I build my buildings in increments of 8 feet. Each building is 16 feet by 16 feet. Each panel locks the other panels into a rigid structure, able to withstand 70 m.p.h. wind gusts. And at night they glow under 12, 48 inch double tube black lights. Its a process of evolution, it keeps growing and changing.",
