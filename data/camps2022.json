When you look inside you see the freshest raspberry with a sprig of bright green mint sitting atop a dark brown and tan mottled surface. You dip your spoon in and the top layer cracks audibly.

Wait til we teach you to throw a dildo and stick it to a glorious Burner target with that feeling of sweet, ejaculatory climax. This is a hands-on, interactive, life-changing event where our M.C. (Master of Cocks) will teach you the tips & tricks for flinging an ersatz penis with abandon and joy for life. You'll need to be prepared for merciless snark and possible interrogation about your past history with dicks. Combine this cum-one, cum-all experience with smooth libations from our distillery, sweet tunes from DJ Deathboy, and questionable henna art on any body part you can fit through the glory hole, and you are certain to have a good time, unless of course you're a darkwad.

Lines of couples flow through each other creating a bonding, playful, noncompetitive, beautifully geometric, community dance for all ages and skill levels. There is no required footwork and contra is possible for many with disabilities. If you are smiling, you are doing it right. Everyone who shows up will have fun.

It appears out of the ether on very special occasions when the colorful progenitor coyotes are summoned to this realm by the secret rituals and dark science of the mysterious Coyote Gardeners. The Interdimensional coyotes are especially active from dusk till dawn, when the garden fully transforms and reveals its truest form. Sometimes pancakes and coffee too.",

    "description": "dEOxidized Camp is about creating community no matter where you are – even on the far reaches of the playa. Our camp is comprised hard working, loving, global influencers. Together, we will co-create an unforgettable experience with our community of friends old and new. Come join us every day in the Deoxidized Oasis, our lounge-type chill space featuring a 60′ parachute shade structure, an open bar, live DJs, informative and vulnerable talks, breath work, yoga, and much more. We'll be hosting talks and classes in the mornings and daily happy hours from 4PM to sunset. Come meet our international crew from across the U.S. and more than a half dozen other countries. We are a diverse group of Burners with much to share and look forward to meeting you! \"",

It is a place for us to gather and affirm our shared humanity, to explore our dreams and desires, to initiate a more conscious journey, and to imagine a joyous future for all. It is an inviting retreat to cherish each other's presence, aiming to grasp what is happening within us in this magical place we call home, and to imagine how to translate what we find here, in the dust, into positive change in the world beyond.

Alkalita provides a funky, social cantina environment where people can mingle and dance to 80's Yacht Rock music while sipping a cold margarita.

We enjoy mass-gifting our fellow Burners with Deep Playa Beer Delivery (quenching the late afternoon thirst in the heat) and 'Smores (late nights in deep playa to ease the chill with warm gooey treats.) Each of those gatherings generates micro-community among those Burners brought together.\n\nThis year, we'll field another mutant vehicle -- having launched TimeCycle ourselves while other years supporting and camping with The Bleachers, Rabid Transit and El Pulpo Mechanico.  Our new ride, Fluffy the Dream Machine, is accessible public transit masquerading as a cloud wafting across the playa.  A wheelchair lift and Braille rails accommodate Burners into the artcar experience.",
