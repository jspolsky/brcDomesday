    "description": "This will be the beginning of my third decade photgraphing the participants of BM.\r\nAt the Free Photography Zone each person is given a print as their tangible reminder of the experience.  No promise to find it on some site.  You get a print then.  \r\nYou will be photographed in a professional studio setting using medium format black and white film.  \r\nWhile good portraits must be a collaboration between two people remember that I can only photograph what you bring to the session.  I have no interest in contributing to the thousands of forgetable \"selfies\" that will be done that week.  I will try to photograph you as best as I can and make an interesting portrait of you.  If all you can do is stand there and re do your high school graduation photo then that is what you will get.\r\nHOWEVER, if you approach the photograph with an open mind and a willingness to try to help me make something interesting you will be rewarded with something unique.\r\nPlease come by, relax in our shade structure, look over prints from previous years, possibly get inspired and most importantly get your portrait done.",

Trey Ratcliff here for the 8th photo walk - Sooo excited!\r\n\r\nDo you like taking photos or perhaps do you like people taking photos of you in all your fabuloso Burner gear? Well come on out and join this fun event - all are welcome! 🙂 It's great for beginner photographers all the way to advanced - bring anything from a mobile phone to a DSLR! We'll roam the streets of BRC and capture some of the magic of Burning Man together. \r\n\r\nI'll be giving lots of tips and tricks to help you on your own creative journey. We also talk a lot about the creative process and how it can be quite an active meditation bringing more consciousness, presence, and awesomeness into your life. So, come, bring a friend or three, and let's have a ball. Word has it that we'll get a bunch of Burner Girls too that just dance around and have thousands of photos taken of them. You know the type. Good times.\r\n\r\nAnd after, we'll share all the photos in the Facebook event at https://goo.gl/PGy7Qq . Check the comments in the event to make some new Instagram friends with fellow photo walkers too! 🙂\r\n\r\nWe'll meet outside of Center Camp TUESDAY at 6 PM and start the crawl from there!",

When we sync up with this cycle, we integrate the wild, wide-ranging scope of who we are and how life moves through us. Movement is the medicine, the metaphor, and the meditation. Our dance becomes the ritual that calls all the pieces of us back into one unified being loving knowing seeing healing whole.

    "description": "Autogenic Training (AT) involves repetitions of a set of visualizations that induce a state of relaxation. AT has been shown to be an effective tool in preventative medicine, stress-related disorders and panic attacks. It can relieve tension, lessen anxiety, and enhance performance. As the world's first western developed mediation technique, AT is a neurological and psycho-physiological tool or therapy for psychological and medical self-healing. \r\n\r\nAT takes you through a series of validated and prescriptive mental exercises that target specific physiological reactions in the brain and body that underpin optimal health and well-being. Through the power of self-suggestion you are taught how to consciously and intentionally control your Autonomic Nervous System. AT is for anyone who wants to benefit from gaining the self-help tools to manage stress in the present and to develop long term strategies to reduce stress and anxiety. It is also of benefit for qualified or trainee psychotherapists who wish to gain a deeper trust in their relationship with 'self' and for those in the caring professions who want to learn new techniques for self-care. The technique was developed by the German psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz and first published in 1932. \r\n\r\nEach session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures (for example, lying down, sitting meditation, sitting like a rag doll).On a micro level of regeneration, Autogenics retrains cells, glands, the brain and organs to behave as they are ‘meant to’, that is, to work in harmony and to restore the natural order. We are now coming to understand AT’s role in neuro-plasticity, gut health, epigenetic modulation and the placebo response. The future for AT world-wide in becoming a mainstream therapy for the self-regulation of body-mind healing and optimal functioning is exciting!",

But male scent, their pheromones and other biochemical signallers contained in sweat and trapped by body hair, has a powerful effect on mood, calmness, hormonal levels and even fertility in heterosexual women. It also surges lutenizing hormones in the brain that allow them to feel much more readily aroused! Who knew the power of the masculine armpit?! Come hug a sweaty bear for your health and well-being!

This workshop is called “Clarity and Consent” because it is about clearly communicating desires and boundaries for consensual sexual activity.\r\n\r\nThe subtitle of this playshop is “Negotiating Sex on the Playa,” so some of the material is about how to get to a positive, consensual agreement. But a negotiation is also successful if it helps to avoid an unwanted outcome, so we also discuss how to convince someone to go away. B.E.D. values the right of individual choice, which includes the right to choose NOT to have sex.\r\n\r\nWe don’t care what gender you appear to be, or what gender you claim to be, or what kinds of partners you prefer. What matters is communication and consent. All are welcome to attend this \"Clarity and Consent Playshop\" presented by the Bureau of Erotic Discourse - at RhythmWave!",

Breathing together is a great way to deepen and bond, so bring your beloved if you choose.\r\n\r\nPlease be sober -- you will not need any additional substance and it can get in the way of your optimal experience. Sovereign Breath creates an altered state in which many experiences are possible facilitated by your higher self. Bring what you most want to release, shift, gain insight about, step into, affirm and create. Be ready for change. This form of breathwork grows out of rebirthing and is a more feminine, gentle and allowing practice than other more aggressive and cathartic forms. This approach makes more effective the integration of your insights and transformation into ordinary reality, and is easier on the nervous system. Deep states of bliss and bonding among participants are common.\r\n\"",

The results were so  potent that David adapted many of the exercises to share in groups.\r\n\r\nIn groups, we focus on generating intimacy, emotional openness, and physical bonding in a safe, slow, guided non-sexual way. We reawaken our primal need for human connection, animal to animal, body to body, heart to heart, without the stress or uncertainty of sex. By trusting our bodies and each other, we reclaim our original innocence... and remember we are safe.\"",

Learn who shows up to our rescue when we are triggered (into primal instincts such as Fight, Flight, Freeze, Submit, and Cry for help). We drop below the thinking mind into the wisdom of the body. To a depth from where it is easy and simple to relate most intimately. Here we drop the guard and lead with the last thing we want our partner to know about us. Vulnerably revealed, 100% responsible, allowing yourself be seen as you are, unedited, undefended, raw and exposed.

It is difficult to identify the genre of this theatre's stagings (as the word \"genre\" in itself implies some kind of traditionalism) and perhaps the company's style is closest to modern choreography in its most nonconformist form. The shows tell no story, reveal no plot, have no dimensions, or narrative. Rather, they mirror reality through dreams, bordering on that thin line between the outer and the inner worlds that interacts with the spectator through their own intuition or unconsciousness. As in the 'absolute mirror', every single person should see in each their work, an inner world and their own particular destiny. \r\nblackSKYwhite has received important awards for innovation in theater at FringeFirst - the international performing arts festival in Edinburgh, Scotland and have headlined performances at Glastronbury Festival. They have performed at Burning Man 2010 also.",

Bring something of your own that is burnable and follows the guidelines to incorporate into your mini effigy. \r\n\r\nAs Larry Says: \"This year we invite participants to create their own burning woman or man. Our theme is Radical Ritual, and what could be more appropriate than to reenact the ritual that founded Burning Man? These figures may be constructed prior to the event, but perhaps an even better option is to craft one in your camp.\"\r\n\r\nYou may not have what it takes to craft one in your camp, so come get crafty in ours and make your best effigy ever!",

Note:    Bring your TI Magazine and we’ll take pics over at the Man! If you’re a Toastmaster and couldn’t be in Washington, DC, for their August International Convention, then bring your CC/CL/other manuals you’d like to advance in, and join us (with friends) for a real Toastmasters meeting - and some photos! We plan to cram in speeches, evaluations, and table topics into a one hour session, or more if demand exists for it, so on time is a good thing. Prompt arrivals will have the best chances for the most fun and credit.    Looking to join in? Pepperland theme camp, Tuesday, 1-2PM.  Email: Gerflash (at) socal (dot) rr (dot) com. so we can plan ahead and count you in.    Just maybe - the pix we take might make it into the TI Magazine! You’ll actually be Toastmastering on-Playa!",

Dr. Jeff Chen MD/MBA, Director of the UCLA Cannabinoid Affinity Group, will take us on a journey through the 10,000+ year history of human cannabis use.  He will then show us the intriguing inter-workings of the human endocannabinoid system, our body's system of natural \"cannabis-like\" molecules.  He will fascinate us with the latest research and science on the health effects of this unique plant.  And he will end with a vision for how cannabis users can help accelerate cannabis research by becoming citizen scientists and donating their data to researchers.",

However, we will be using polymer or sculpey baking clay for this project using a traditional rolled cane method for our design. Fun way to learn and take home a new skill as well create a pretty wearable piece of art. All skill levels welcome, subject of the design TBD based on consensus and or skill level of the class :) We plan to then bake the beads after the class. They can be worn on necklaces or crafted into buttons so feel free to bring your own necklace material, twine, or pins to attach to the polymer clay. Plan to spend about 45min to an hour creating your beautiful beads and approximately an additional 20 minutes for bake time in our ovens! All ages and skill levels welcome. Clay will be provided but feel free to bring your own if you brought some by chance to the playa. Due to limited supplies/tools and seating (unless you bring your own supplies and tools), the class will be first come first serve.",

Okay not really, but we pretend murder them at murder mystery parties.  So we thought, why not bring this kind of fun home with us?\r\n\r\nWe will host at three scheduled murders through-out the week, each being about an hour and a half event. Everyone gets a character to play and clues to help solve the murder. There is an emcee that keeps things moving along but this is performance art in its rawest form, everyone is a suspect (or the recently deceased) and it is up to the group to collaborate, negotiate shady agreements, blackmail or otherwise enjoy themselves.\r\n\r\nEach murder requires twenty people to play the roles for each murder we commit.  Each murder has a theme; a Circus, Santa's Workshop and an 80's Homecoming murder.  We encourage participants to come in costume and/or fully embrace their character.  We're snarky too so if people need a clue right there on the spot, a clue will be written for them and handed over in a small envelope.  A sample clue would be: \"Shave your goatee, with a knife, to get more pussy, in the lounge, you fucking hippie.\"  It's a silly good time and everyone gets drunk or hydrated, meets new people and whether they crack the case or not they win shit for best actor, best briber, best sleuth, best dressed.\r\n\r\nOn the days we're not committing foul play we will host a bar and a water hydration station (a giant igloo dispenser available throughout the entire day, filled with Earth20 from Bend, Oregon and chilled with a block of ice).",

Contra is fast-paced and exciting, yet easy to learn. A \"caller\" instructs, but there is room for dancers to improvise and embellish. There is no need to arrive with a partner – most dancers swap after each dance. Lines of couples flow through each other creating a bonding, playful, noncompetitive, all-ages community dance. There is no required footwork and contra is possible for many with disabilities. If you are smiling, you are doing it right. Everyone who shows up will have fun, and will probably find they can't stop from joining in on the hooting and stomping.   Videos at the website.  You can contradance all over the US  (and a smattering of other countries) in dance halls with up to a thousand people.  But the Playa makes it special so you should try it with us first!",

    "description": "\"High energy beats, massage, up-regulating breathwork, Taoist big draws, awakening energy and intense mind altering sober psychedelic experience.\r\n--\r\n\r\nOften in moments of intense experiences we find answers to solutions we could not access. Benjamin facilitates an experience through high energy beats, partner based massage, up-regulating breathwork, Taoist big draws, and awakening energy with the potential to unlock intense mind altering sober psychedelic experiences. Are you curious?\r\n\r\nThe workshop explores embodiment using one-directional partnered massage. Each set of paired individuals will explore what it means to be in their bodies and fully present while receiving one-directional touch from their chosen giver. If an individual can master blocks in their own body, search for releases, discover new methods, or find hidden gems from being present, it creates a foundation of opportunities that can be unleashed. Some benefits to receiving one-directional touch can be:\r\n• Self awareness\r\n• Communication skills\r\n• Desires & goals\r\n• Coping with insecurities\r\n• Decision making\r\n• Shifting mental states\r\n• Letting go (aka release)\r\n• Moving forward\r\n• Opening doors\r\n\r\nHow to prepare:\r\nThis workshop is partner based or can be experienced solo. A crucial consent, boundaries, and communication section will be covered at the beginning. Individuals will have an opportunity to choose a partner. Please be open to same gender pairings. Triad groups are also encouraged, however one person will not be able to receive due to time constraints. This work can include genital or anal touch, but is not required or expected. You can be fully clothed or naked as when you were born. We mention this so you can be comfortable with others choices in a shared space and define your own boundaries.",

Feel the fullness that arises from within. Breathe deeply into your sovereign experience. Land, ground into your sense of self and feel your boundaries in relation to others.\r\nMeeting and greeting new people in a festival environment is inherently exciting and anxiety provoking. From a survival standpoint we are testing strangers before we invite them in.

Let us pamper and refresh you before you head back out for a night of debauchery. Relax in our cuddle puddle with aromatherapy cooling towels and face masks, refreshing drinks at our bar, or take a quick nap in our cooling hammocks.\r\n\r\nDuring the Evening Disco Spa, our licensed massage therapist, Scott, will provide quick massages to refresh your weary body. (Due to the time constraint, we will ask that people sign up for a time slot in advance). Our trained barista, Kyle, will provide guests with coffee samples to give them that boost of energy for the night. Nurse Rico will be on hand to make sure you are hydrated at our hydration station. Our resident DJs will provide you with funky beats for you to begin your night with dancing under our disco ball. Our trained bartenders will be serving magical cocktails (and mocktails). The Never-Land Disco Spa will run from 8 - 10 PM on Thursday night. We can't wait to pamper you.",

    "description": "Wait...What? You Want What Where? Congratulations! Has your partner approached you with the idea of ass play? Is it exciting...and confusing...and perhaps a little scary? This pegging workshop is open to everyone but tailored to female-identifying humans—pegging princesses in training! Regardless of the anatomy with which you were born, sticking things in your ass feels good. In fact, prostate stimulation can produce orgasms up to 10 times stronger and/or more intense than an average genital-stimulation-only orgasm (lucky prostate owners). Pegging is about pleasure plain and simple and humans are enjoying ass play and pegging without shame or stigma now more than ever. Ass play is for everyone! I’ve been ass fucking and blogging my way to pegging princess empowerment for 12 years and want to share my love of all things penetration with you. I LOVE pegging. It makes me feel powerful, sexy, and feminine. I love the view, I love the adoration I get in return, and I love being a part of heightened levels of sexual pleasure for my partner. Pegging need not be about dominating, humiliating, or degrading your partner.  Join me as we leave our fears behind, bring pegging out of the shadows and into the lighter side of kink, and explore safe pegging 101 and beginner equipment. The workshop includes an interactive demonstration, question and answer, and a few surprises. Now let’s rock out with our girl cocks out!",

    "description": "We may often avoid eye contact with “strangers” in society. However, sharing unbroken eye contact may increase your mindfulness and deepen your connections with people. Like meditation, eye gazing may leave you feeling more spiritually open, connected and relaxed. The difference with eye gazing is that you share these experiences with another person. People who have eye gazed have made long life connections, and even found love! Will you find love looking into the eyes of a stranger? Although we cannot guarantee this, but we can however facilitate a place for those willing to share an unbroken gaze into the eyes of a stranger. The space will be available for 30 minutes. Gazing partners will be limited to the number of consenting gazers in the space. Importantly there is not a time limit you can gaze for as long as or a little as you feel comfortable. We will not force gazing time and if any gazer decides to end a gaze we respect their decision. To get started we suggest you try eye gazing with someone you know for a minute. If you are not immediately ready to dive into a gaze feel free to watch other eye gazers. You may find mediating a few minutes before a gaze may ease you into it.",

    "description": "\"2 of the most natural + nourishing forms of human intimacy. Experience ways to get more out of these interactions than you ever thought possible!\r\n\r\nMost people avoid eye contact, especially prolonged, and are pretty uncomfortable in a long embrace. Is it any wonder? Did you ever take a class in either of these? Was physical and emotional intimacy part of your schooling? Has anyone ever shown you or taught you HOW to do these things? No. Our culture could care less about how we demonstrate love and affection for one another. That's for the birds, right? Well, no. Women need face to face eye contact with their mates on a daily basis to feel relaxed. They need to be seen. And everyone needs to be touched, lovingly and respectfully, with consent.

We are on the verge of the next planetary extinction event.  Meanwhile, the 99%, glued to government-manipulated media, wallows in wanton complacency.  \r\n\r\nNow, women are rising up and re-taking the reins. Because of our biochemical makeup, we are scientifically proven to be more compassionate and less aggressive (the vast majority of all past and current peaceful societies are “matriarchal”).  \r\nI propose an end to complacency, and offer a passionate call to action.

The flow wand (aka levitation stick) is a flow prop that is inspired from a classic magic trick called the \"Dancing Cane\".  It is a cleverly balanced stick with a thin, invisible string somewhere in the middle that is also attached to the to the magician.  The magician appears to control the cane with his mind, the cane seemingly floating in mid-air, while making it dance to music.  Recently the Flow wand was introduced into the juggling community, so in this workshop you can learn everything to get started with this magical prop.",

All relationships, every shape and size, have the ability to lead us deeper into the mystery of who we truly are. \r\n\r\nWhere we are the most vulnerable, we have the strongest defenses. And it just so happens, we are the most vulnerable in our intimate and romantic relationships. \r\n\r\nSo... \r\n໑ How do we handle the strong instincts that kick in when we are triggered? \r\n໑ What to do when we are overwhelmed and projecting our past fears on the future? \r\n໑ Is there an alchemical relational process that makes gold out of led? \r\n໑ Can we transform our wounds, the most ugly aspects in us and our protective instincts, into an even deeper intimacy? \r\n໑ Can we unshackle biology and conditioning so that we can be truly free to love?\r\n\r\nDuring this 3 intensive we will guide you through simple and effective ways to come back to love, to transform what keeps you small and to take brave steps into all that you are.

    "description": "French Maids have become indispensable to the spiritual progress of Black Rock City, no more so than in 2017 with the unprecedented proliferation of altars, most of which have ceased to function properly. Reports have come in that these altars are of no spiritual benefit whatsoever. In fact, the consensus among the BMOrg is that the spiritual growth of Burning Man has somehow been stunted. It’s been scientifically proven that the spiritual efficacy of altars is greatly diminished by even trivial amounts of dust. Fortunately, the French Maid Brigade, summoned to task by the BMOrg, is on hand to correct this situation. No matter how much dust your radical ritual kicks up, French Maids will be there to ensure a spiritual journey unencumbered by dust.\r\n\r\nRendezvous with us! You too can be one of the sexiest clean freaks on the playa—please bring: feather dusters, rags, dustbusters, service carts, vacuums, white gloves, latex gloves, enema kits, lube, and any other useful cleaning equipment. Join us in uniform with your surly attitude and worst possible French accent.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday at 2:00 pm we meet at 3 O’Clock and Esplanade then dust our way through every filthy, nasty camp on our march toward that dust bucket known as Center Camp Café, liberate them from their dusty oppression, and celebrate our triumph!",

Now. Please. stamps verifying their age, they enter the GameBar.  The GameBar games are a mash-up of twister, musical chairs, and hot lava.  Stools, tables and counters are spread out over a platform.  Each stool has a different color and colored spots are on the bar, the floor, the monkey bars overhead and even the swings on the edge.  Some stools even have numbers or symbols.  The bartender picks from a stack of overly large cards to find out what happens next (or they can just make up a new rule!).  For example, It could be that all people sitting on yellow seats have to go to a blue seat, but they can’t touch the ground, hot lava!  They must climb over and around people, keeping hold of their drinks, of course!  They may have to get a partner and find seats that add up to a certain number.  They may need to have a hand on a certain color and the butts on a different color.  They may have to sit on the bar, hang from the monkey bar, sit on the monkey bar, one foot on a swing, one hand on...the bartender themselves!  There are so many versions and iterations of different rules that the fun is endless.   The patrons will be encouraged, through the cards, to interact with each other as well as those in the street.  There are no points and not even a goal of the game other than to share in the fun and make some new friends!\r\nBartenders wear matching twister-themed outfits and carry super soaker water guns filled with a tasty cocktail.  There is no “bar” in our bar unless you count the monkey bar!  The bartenders roam around the platform, serving our special blend to the patrons.  \r\n \r\nThe GameBar will be open Monday - Saturday 5pm - 9pm for happy hour game time.",

    "description": "Blintzkrieg is a theme camp centered on the ritual of breaking fast to the core of people’s beings by nourishing their tummies and taste buds with delicious and surprising flavors. After a long night on the playa wouldn’t you like a “schmoke und a pancake? No?” Well then, how about a blintz!\r\n \r\nWhat is a blintz?  It’s like a crepe, only tastier and more transportable, something quintessential when it comes to all the lightning-quick decisions you have to make on the playa.  A blintz is one standard-issue crepe pancake combined with a sweet, cottage cheese-like filling (or a savory potato and onion filling) that is then rolled into a small burrito-like form to fit nicely in the palm of your hand. Delicious!\r\n \r\nCome groove with the camp and ask your skilled blintz chefs for the latest flavor, and hang around in our shade structures to meet other hungry travelers. Blintzes will be offered every day from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, or until we’re out of blintzes",

Just that this one feature needs enhancement? Or what if oral just never seems to be part of the picture? Let’s change that situation! Men, there are things YOU can do to: • Help your partner be more comfortable going down on you. • Help your partner be more WILLING to go down on you • Help your partner learn how to pleasure you better. Come learn tips to increase the likelihood of your getting the oral sex you fantasize. And, women, if you’d like to be more comfortable going down on your partner - or if you have a pet peeve that you’d like to share so men know to NEVER do that thing you hate - come join the discussion. Here’s a chance to ask question and share feedback. This is a discussion-only event. No live demos. Singles welcome. Ages 21 and up, with ID.",

    "description": "Emotional (or motivational) flow is what happens when you're present in your immediate circumstances and connected to what you really want in this moment. It is a foundation for fulfilling, connected, and self-expressed action.  \r\n\r\nIn this experiential workshop we explore how we can use immediacy and to guide us back into a state of emotional and motivational flow. The goal here is to unhitch ourselves from three patterns that block us from flow: rehearsing thoughts, reacting from emotions, and re-referencing emotions. We'll use interactive physical exercises to explore the felt sense \"stuck\" that these three patterns of being create. Then we'll expand that felt understanding through a guided emotional flow meditation.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this workshop is not to offer a tool to practice emotional flow in the future, but to create an experiential understanding of how we can meet emotions to return to emotional and motivational flow.",

The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality. You don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to get there. The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. How? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory \"hooks\" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel \"good.” We will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process. After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group. We look forward to sharing your future day together. Dr. Feelgood.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 45 Minute Meditation Session is 2PM M-F and followed up with creative cocktails, step up and have a feel good drink at our Camp Feel Good Compliment Bar/Sherpa Foot washing station!\r\n\r\nFor those in need of a deep dive in what you want out of life, we offer an Advice Booth Open every day!",

Specific musical instruments played during the meditation allow participants to use sound as a therapeutic tool to disconnect from discursive thinking and delve into a transcendental state. The goal is to enable participants to disengage their undesirable habitual patterns and to empower positive cognitive change. Most of the instruments used in a Sound Meditation are overtone-emitting instruments such as gongs, Tibetan singing bowls, bells, metallic discs, etc. These instruments have been used in meditation and sound healing for centuries in many cultures and continue to be used.\r\nAlexandre has conducted ethnomusicology fieldwork for 18 years in over 40 countries. His research investigates issues of acculturation, community, musical identity in an urban setting, and the concepts of talent, charisma, and leadership in music.",

Harm Reduction is also a movement for social justice built on a belief in the fundamental civil rights of people who use drugs. Mitchell Gomez will host this 'introduction to harm reduction' talk, with an open Q&A at the end. Today, electronic music is the fastest growing youth culture, and the community DanceSafe serves stretches far and wide. Current programs and initiatives aim to provide safe spaces to engage in conversations about health, drug use, and personal safety; provide free water, electrolytes, safe sex tools, and ear plugs at EDM events; provide honest, fact-based, unbiased information on drug effects and potential harms; offer nonjudgmental first-point of contact to risky or challenging situations; offer drug checking services to prevent overdoses and death; and work with promoters and local stakeholders to advocate for safety first approaches. Come hear Mitchell from DanceSafe talk about harm reduction in general, and it's application to Burn Culture (as well as unique challenges of the Playa).",

We are asking Burners to radically participate on the Playa in 2017 by reading a single page from Chapter 6 of Joyce's masterpiece on camera.\r\n\r\nThis will be our second year filming a chapter of Wake at Burning Man. In 2016, we filmed 121 Burners perform chapter 7 (Shem the Penman) of Wake. Here are a few short clips from last year's episode:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/50hbiUY87W0\r\n\r\nPlease choose the page you'd like to perform this year from chapter 6 of FW at this link:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.finwake.com/1024chapter6/1024finn6.htm\r\n\r\nYou can also bring along your favorite piece of music on your phone to accompany your reading if you like, and we will run the audio for your performance thru our mixer.\r\n\r\nThe final goal of our Finnegan Wakes project is to provide the world with the first ever complete edition of Finnegans Wake on film, performed by Burners from around the world.\r\n\r\nWe'll be posting updates at the FB group in this posting regarding when and where we'll be filming performances around BRC so please join the FB group for updates. This year, Finnegans Wake on the Playa will be based in the Dream-Land of Camp Fuego at 6:15 and H.\r\n\r\nThe complete episode (chapter 7) from 2016 can be viewed here:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/yReE0yoVTSE",

(You can use the break for lunch or try some of our big toys, such as aerial rig or gymnastics wheel). At the last stage, the pots have to be fired after Burning Man, but we could ship your masterpiece to you, if you’d like! Otherwise, we’ll use it to decorate our camp and use the most appealing ones to award the winners of our athletic events next year.",

    "description": "Do you want to try something completely new? We’re all looking for ways to have experiences that really rock our world and awaken our senses! Here’s your chance to experience something we guarantee you’ve never felt before! Eros Tangeré is a one-on-one “tactile performance” that can only be described as a sensation experience that is created as your very body is played as if it were an ever changing organic musical instrument. Your body becomes the surface upon which amazing erotic sensations will cascade with the undulations of an amazing music track and scent. Imagine that you can FEEL the expression of music with your body. Shed of your clothes, you lay prone and robbed of your sense of sight, one of our artists will perform upon your body with the music in ways that you have never experienced. This is a unique and creative custom designed sensory performance. Not for the faint of heart. Eros Tangeré is a one on one, sensual adult event. Space is very limited so signing up for a session prior to start time is highly recommended. Check in at the Camp for Sensual Pleasures inside Spanky’s Wine Bar for more info and times. 18+, Ladies Only. This has become a hit-favorite at Burning Man, do not miss it. Appointments are limited.",

The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits.

Your feet will be grounded, but with 12 gauge hooks in your chest, your mind will be soaring. You can choose your own adventure, either solo pulling or connecting to a group to feel the impact each person can make. We will be piercing for 2 hours but you can pull for as long as you want after that. You can even keep the hooks to show off to anyone who doesn’t believe how tough you are. Supportive people/partners and respectful spectators are welcome, but only consenting sober adults will be pierced.",

Bring water or hydration liquid. We have sticks for U. Master Mai Bac Dao developed Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of the North Vietnamese Army. He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain health thru LSA, and vowed if he was ever freed, he’d dedicate his life to spread its benefits, with this proviso: No trainer may ever charge for it. (Like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, moved to Southern California, and taught classes of students and future teachers. Today, weekly classes abound in So Cal, around the US, & the world.

    "description": "\"BOTH genders are welcome in this gender fluid workshop!\r\n\r\n(The terms female/women or male/men are used loosely indicating people who self identify as male or female.)\r\n\r\nIn this last year and a half I have been delving into sexuality and examining societal beliefs around intimacy. It has become clear to me that sexuality is a fast track to discovering the blind spots which hinder us from intimacy. One of the most fruitful areas of exploration for myself has been in the area of male to male intimacy and gender fluidity. Through my experiences i have found that most men are guarded in ways that protect them from experiencing doubt around their own male sovereignty. For example most of us have been taught that to be affectionate with other males is wrong and means that we are \"\"homosexual\"\" or weak. \r\n\r\nA recent study by Harvard shows that humans are actually gender fluid and most of our gender identity is indoctrinated into us through our family systems, society, and the media. \r\n\r\nThe fruit which comes from exploring male to male intimacy on an energetic and physical level is that all of our male armor/guarded defense systems vanish and we develop a greater level or capacity for intimacy with all people including women. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the workshop allows men to explore their relationships with their fathers, brothers and friends and then moves gently towards male to male affection, culminating in energetic play with sexual energy. This is not a clothing optional work shop, personal boundaries will be respected all of the time, and personal safety a priority! Participants will always be at choice and have a multitude of different opportunities with which to explore this theme. Women will hold space and at times participate in this exploration and benefit from observing what occurs in the room. \r\n\r\nGratitude and blessings\r\n\r\nTimothy\"",

    "description": "When someone says \"Midnight Ridazz!!\" \r\nYou say \"RIDE ON!!\"\r\n\r\nThe Midnight Ridazz is formally described as a group of bicycle enthusiasts who have been riding together on the second Friday of every month since February of 2004. Originally conceived and founded by SKULL and lovingly cared for by MABELL, MUFF and a small group of planners and care takers, the rides quickly grew from the original 8 \"Mammas and Papas\" to current ride counts of 1300+ Ridazz.\r\n\r\nSkeptics may scoff at the irreverence of this alleged \"Party on Wheels.\" But the party atmosphere just might be what has made this simple bicycle ride so popular in a city like Los Angeles where people barely get their mail without hopping in a car. Some attribute the movement to the high assed gas prices, or the frustration of LA traffic. Still others simply write off the Midnight Ridazz as a bunch of bored art school students. It's all of these things and more! \r\n\r\nConsider: Riding a bicycle is a sensual alternative to the \"boy in the bubble\" car voyages that hide everything good that a city has to offer. It is an experience in sights, sounds, thrills, physical activity, and local economy that could never be replicated by a night out at (Sh)City Walk. Midnight Ridazz is about riding bicyles, hanging out, acting silly, being whimsical, speaking up, and having a good heart. Come out and enjoy a relaxed pace bicycle ride at the end of a week of computers, dispatchers, rude customers, corporate politics and all the other crap that comes with living in a world of sad clowns. Banish the clowns! Send in the Ridazz.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOIN US.\r\nMoving forward we're inviting everybody to join in the fun. The Ridazz that be have created this site to help empower YOU to create your own rides, routes and good timezz. Start yourself a recurring ride, have a bar crawl or even throw a one timer in the daylight... It's your ride.",

    "description": "Join Camp Feel Good for a guided creative visualization meditation. Dr. Feelgood will help you picture your perfect day 10 years in your future. The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality. You don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to get there. The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. How? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory \"hooks\" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel \"good.” We will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process. After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group. We look forward to sharing your future day together. Dr. Feelgood.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 45 Minute Meditation Session is 2PM M-F and followed up with creative cocktails, step up and have a feel good drink at our Camp Feel Good Compliment Bar/Sherpa Foot washing station!\r\n\r\nFor those in need of a deep dive in what you want out of life, we offer an Advice Booth Open every day!",

Take a guided meditative tour of the night sky, combining spirituality, music and physics. Led by our resident astronomer and PhD physicist (Nir Lahav), we'll journey from our galaxy to deep outer space, exploring the meaning of the universe and life in the cosmos. Relax, breathe deep, tune in. Located in deep dark Playa near Black Rock Observatory.\r\n\r\nThe ritual begins at 11:30 with drumming, vocal toning, and other healing sounds. The alignment itself takes center stage just a few minutes before and after midnight. Nir will then center our minds with conscious breathing before focusing our attention on the night sky's mysteries and wonder.  Healers bring vocal toning, singing bowls and drums into the mix, with NASA’s space-sound recordings in which the planets sing. 11:30pm to 12:30am.",

Learn the basics of spanking, paddling, flogging, and whipping. During the class, participants will study how to gently bind, blindfold, gag, and/or prepare their partner for a round of loving smacks, whips, and spanks. Engage in sensual play designed to express love through pain and power tactics. Understand the difference between doms and subs and discover your true nature in the realm of BDSM. Mistress Jade will personally guide each couple in how to manipulate, treat, and care for their bodies and how to avoid hurt and confusion during play. Materials will be provided, but feel free to bring your own love instruments to class. \r\n\r\nMistress Jade runs a tight ship. There is a strict hassle-free class rule: no threatening, close-minded, or rude participants will be allowed to stay. Check all your expectations and predispositions at the door. All students can expect a safe, supportive, and encouraging atmosphere. But beware, you WILL give and receive some loving pain, and you will always thank your hostess and your partners when doing so. Now don't be late! There will be a price to pay...that only your sweet bottom can afford!",

    "description": "Nudity has the power to surprise and shock, yet why, on reflection, can something as mundane as the naked body inspire simultaneously so much passion and revulsion? To be naked in 21st century western society demands intense self-examination, the questioning and reappraisal of conventional conventions and morality. In this sense, naturism, as the cultural and political movement of nudism is often known, is an inherently philosophical practice. And what better way to do philosophy than naked? We’re sure your college seminars would have been much more fun nude. Come and join us for lively discussions, debates and story-telling. We’ll be discussing naturism, body image, sharing experiences, debating body modification, if and how laws should be changed – really everything related to the human body.",

Help create an ever changing wall of artistic expression which will bring beauty and inspiration to the people of the playa. \r\nThe wall is a 24 foot long 4 foot high blank canvas which is comprised of 8 interlocking 4' x 3' canvases. It will be primed and ready for you to get your art on! As the week goes by the wall will evolve into a community mural for the citizens by the citizens! \r\nAll individuals, whether master artists or stick figure lovers, are invited to participate. Paint as much as you like or observe from our viewing bench.\r\nWe will supply all brushes and paint for the wall. Basic painting instruction will be provided if requested. Music will be playing from behind the wall so you can dance along with the colors as you choose. Lights will be on for evening viewing (or painting if we stay open late). The wall will be open for creativity Monday - Friday 10am and stay open until 6pm (or later).\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the wall will be dismantled. Each of the 8 individual canvases which comprised the wall will be randomly gifted to citizens of the community. These amazing gifts will hold the work of hundreds of passing artists creating magic memories of BRC 2017!",

Gina will be exposing  you to concepts that will take your dance to the next level.

Spirit animal is a culturally appropriated term which bastardized an important and significant Native American spiritual practice into white girls calling Lindsay Lohan their spirit animal as she crashes her car drunk with Coke all over her nose. Patronus is the non-offensive Harry Potter originated word that is the animal that forms at the end of your wand to protect against dementors. #themoreyouknow \r\n\r\nNot sure what your Patronus is? Here's an easy quiz to find out: https://tinyurl.com/lx2k7rz\r\n\r\nFor the past nine years, a Seattle-based group of friends have been traveling to Burning Man, spreading the love of Burning Man upon return, and growing larger with each burn. In 2016, Champagne Campaign was first officially placed as a registered theme camp. The universal activity enjoyed by this group of friends is meeting at 12:00 in front of the temple every sunrise for a champagne toast to the new day. This group of friends has continued the sunrise tradition at home in Seattle, and plans sunrise champagne events during the summer. At Burning Man, Champagne Campaign is an interactive camp that hosts daily debates in a campaign-esque setting. Our champagne bar is open during debate hours to encourage lively debates paired with champagne party punch. We encourage lively debates where people are free to give their opinion no matter the absurdity and engage themselves among burners of all different backgrounds and opinions. Champagne Campaign returns to Burning Man in 2017 in that hopes that it will continue to be an interactive inclusive theme camp for years to come on playa as well as in Seattle. All proceeds go to getting our camp to the playa and stocking our bar so we can gift the joy of champagne all week long!",

    "description": "Through the gates of dawn to the endless river, take a journey through time and space as we immerse ourselves in a flow of instrumental excerpts from over 40 years of the Pink Floyd discography.  Be inspired to dance and meditate, release your inner animal and break through your walls. From the dark side of the moon to the heart of the sun, the tiniest atom to the great interstellar expanse, the pulse of life to the great beyond, let us leave behind our divisions.  The eclipse brings darkness, yet the light ever returns.  We will always shine on, my bright ambassadors!  When the time comes, my only thought will be, I wish you were here.  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \r\nA note from the arranger:  This has been a project long in the making.  I have often felt the call of the dance from Pink Floyd’s music, momentary spans from so many different songs that called out to be joined together in one great epic track.  What you will hear has been carefully selected, shaped and spliced together to create a seamless experience, from a meditative beginning, ever amplified with a gentle rise in intensity, until we reach a riotous celebration of life and energy at the peak.   Like life itself, we release completely, winding down to a great finality.  What is at the end of our journey?  Have we lived our lives as completely and fully as we ever desired, as we look back from that long road?  We can only answer these questions for ourselves.  I invite you to take this opportunity to reflect on these things, and be yourself, as completely and fully as possible.   Let us live in a world we call can share.  With Love, Blue Jay",

Pharmakon, open M-F mornings, 11am-1pm from, is the yourt \"Oh, gawd!\" hangover recovery station, replete with a full menu of tried and true playa picker uppers. \r\n\r\nThis year we have broadened Pharmakon’s offerings to include simple first aid items for (hapless) virgin burners who find themselves unprepared. We have found even seasoned burners can be surprised by the fragility of their bodies in our dusty wonderland. By offering various OTC remedies we hope to mitigate trivial demands on Rampart medical services and provide a gentle lesson in self-sufficiency along with the bandaid and a hug. (Unfortunately we will no longer be offering ameliorative trepanning or exorcisms as we broke the skull drill and drank all the holy water). \r\n\r\nFATHER JACK'S PANTY SHACK offers solace for souls experiencing that ‘not so fresh’ feeling. Eager participants in need of a little freshening up can score a dainty thong, beefy briefs or a naughty hybrid that tap dances on the line between decency and profane. You never know what you’ll find when you put your hand inside the box of mystery but we can promise you’ll get rousing applause, catcalls and possibly even a consensual reacharound as you model your new underoos for our staff of helpful shackmasters.",

Along with it you get a permanent marker. When you get a shirt, put it on and go out and start giving some hugs (with permission)! When you've given 10 hugs, sign your shirt with the permanent marker and pass both your shirt and the marker to another amazing hugger. The group keeps changing, the love keeps flowing, and who knows, maybe you'll see your jersey again later on in the burn? How many names will be on it? How many hugs have been shared with it? \r\n\r\n\"We hug to experience one another without words, to share a momentary physical connection that says, 'I love you, you’re safe, you’re good, you’re worthy.'\" -Playa Hug Team Motto",

    "description": "Join Power of Prayer with First Nations' Wisdom Keepers, Red Lightning, Mayan Warrior and Unify for a Global Synchronised Prayer Drumming Circle.\r\n\r\nRed Lightning began with a vision to hold a sacred space on the Playa.  Now, returning from Standing Rock to Black Rock, we come together with global synchronised prayer platform Unify, and cultural force Mayan Warrior, to continue the prayer that started at Standing Rock.\r\n\r\nFor generations, Native American culture has held that the drum is the heartbeat of Mother Earth, and the water, her veins.  Indigenous tribes use drums in various ways to interact with a higher power, known to many as The Great Spirit.  Drums are the channel we use to connect to our spirit, to each other, and to the spirit of Earth. Water is sacred.  MNI WICONI!\r\n\r\nThe historic, global gathering of hundreds of tribes at Standing Rock standing together for the first time for our water has been prophesied for these times.  Now, we gather under the Medicine Wheel of all nations to carry this prayer forward.  It has been said that peace will not come to our Earth until the circle of humanity is complete; until all four colours sit in circle under the Medicine Wheel and share their teachings. \r\n\r\nCome and experience our unification as a human family as we dance together under the Medicine Wheel to the beat of the drum, playing out to all of Black Rock City on the Playa's best sound-system.  Pray with us on the Playa or engage with us online as we stream our prayer out to over 15 million people using Unify's platform. Join us.  Together, we pray for good health and better understanding.  Together, we pray for deep listening.  Together, we pray for unity, for peace, and for love. \r\n\r\nThis is a historic moment you won't want to miss.\r\n\r\nThis is our Radical Ritual.",

Pralaya Yoga was developed specifically to support joint longevity as well as to prevent and speed recuperation from the common problems in sports and daily life.\" On Wednesday at 10:AM, we'll gather at General Portrait Studio.  Our 90 minute class will contain some lecture and some practice.  When we finish, you're encouraged to explore their amazing and welcoming camp (Get pictures of your favorite body part, ice cold beverages, great music, Sea Dragon art car, aerial rig, and warm hugs). On our journey, we'll: 1. Generate Life Energy through Ancient Tibetan breathing techniques. 2. Find ways to Challenge your Body (safely). 3. Explore a dozen different ways to Increase Flexibility in a joint.  4. Discuss the usual cause of any Joint Pain (especially lower back) and how to Avoid/Fix the pain. 5. Compare and feel the effects of these sacred Pranayamas and Asanas in your own body. 6. Understand that Pranayamas are ENERGY exercises, not just breathing exercises. 7. Leave Energized, Elevated and Equipped with new ideas to explore. If you have a mat and/or block, please bring them. All are welcome. Advanced Yogis Encouraged! I promise to challenge you.  Physically, Mentally and Spiritually. I look forward to showing you what I’ve learned from my amazing teachers. Please join us!",

    "description": "Join Sarah McManus on discussing robust and resilient systems to help us navigate the challenges that face humanity, in ways that steer between the rocky shoals of nihilistic meaninglessness and the treacherous whirlpools of self-delusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Sarah McManus was hired to be a research director at an ayahuasca center in Peru... and then fired for being too rational. She has a BA in Ecology from New College of Florida, a school that explicitly values ecstatic wonder. She was in a PhD program for Integrative Conservation, but left after realizing that humanity’s socioecological crises won't be solved by data alone: we need better tools for looking at hard problems with self-compassion, and for communicating and coordinating to co-create solutions. She writes about these topics, as well as psychedelic integration, at pricklesandgoo.com. \r\n\r\n \r\nThese places where reason and spirituality come into conflict can provide fertile ground for cultivating new ways of understanding and relating. If we can turn towards the tensions that arise when our existing belief structures are not able to meet our needs, we can find opportunities to help those frameworks grow and expand. I want to make spaces where we can allow our sense of the sacred to encompass the deep and beautiful metaphors that science has discovered, and where we can allow our need for analytical understanding to take in the complexity and uncertainty of the world in all its rich variety.",

We utilize music, intention, ritual, energy work and guidance to help you access Source, your inner Divinity, your true essence of being.  This transcendental breathwork guides you to awaken, to remember, to transform.  \r\n\r\nBy breathing in a conscious, connected, circular manner, you are actively breathing  life force energy into your Being; and, in doing so, you are inviting the intelligence that lives within the breath to dissolve, melt, release any blockages,  suppressed and/ or repressed emotions and experiences from our past.  In releasing the old, the stagnant, the unconscious patterning using your breath as your healing modality, you also then are open to receiving the “new” — new information, clarity, confirmation, creative expansion, and a whole host of possibilities based on your soul’s desires.\r\n\r\nWhile some people use plant medicines to access these non-ordinary states of consciousness, we will only be using our breath in our session — nothing will be ingested other than deeply connecting with our breath.  It is important that you are not under the influence of any substances during our time together.\r\nPlease bring an eye mask or bandana, yoga mat (or something to lie on), blanket(s) and a pillow.

    "description": "Join us anytime in a ritual to un-fuck your burn. Planned Playahood is proud to present our new birth canal, for you to shed the sins of yesterday and be reborn unto the dust. Spend a meditative moment in our womb of a dome, then climb into the canal and be delivered! Squeeze your way through and start the rest of your new life! It won't hurt...much. Our nearby bar, The Rusty Speculum, is open from noon to midnight. Please B.Y.O.S (Bring Your Own Sins).\r\n\r\nParticipants navigate an obstacle course of contraception devices through the interior orifice and twisty turns of the birth canal, reproducing something that we all have in common: that moment we entered into this self-reliant dusty life. Swat a sperm-shaped tether ball, pass through a leaky condom, jump over a big freakin’ bible, through a coat hanger, climb a set of stairs to nowhere, chill in the womb. \r\nCulminates in a slide through a giant vagina where you are re-birthed near the bar and greeted with heckling encouragement and a possible spank on the bottom from a genuine playa doctor. During clinic events, our camp members will guide canal visitors: If you need lube or a slap on the ass we are there for you. But the experience stands alone at any time of day or night. The love canal loves to be explored.",

    "description": "We at RAD Services are dedicated to imbuing your ritual with auditory and visual zing. RAD maintains a list of ritual augmentation providers and pairs them with ritual events.  Attend office hours or just drop on by and ring the bell for service!  And those wanting to join team RAD Services are invited to contact us!  \r\n\r\nWe at RAD Services aren't going to own/produce/design your ritual. We don't loan/gift equipment to you. What we do is show up in person, with our stuff, and augment/decorate your ritual with visual pizzazz and auditory depth!\r\n\r\nHere is a list of some of the services that we provide (some best in low light venues):\r\n\r\n- LED image painting: Image poi, with is a programmable sticks of LEDs, can trace out any image when moved or spun, e.g., fire, lightening, patterns, words, pictures, etc.  Also, these LED props can produce interesting visual affects even when not moved quickly, e.g., flames, fuses, torches, pulsating lights, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n- Sound: We at RAD are able to provide a wide range of mobile audio support, e.g., music for a parade/procession or clear dialog for weddings or other ceremonies. Our electric trike moves the audio with your moving ritual/parade.\r\n\r\n- Fire: Torches, staff, fire ropes, orbs, poi spinning, etc.\r\n\r\n- Video: Front or back lit video projection can help add a new layer of interest to your ritual. You provide the projection surface (e.g., EasyUp side wall) and we bring the equipment.\r\n\r\n- Blinky: Many props to decorate any low light ritual, including: LED poi (dynamic color changes), LED staff (two image poi brought together), LED image poi (see above), fiber optic whips (think swarm of fire flies).\r\n\r\n- Music: Airy Native American flute background music and parade drum cadence music services are available.\r\n\r\nSo, you come up with the ritual and we at RAD help make it even more awesome. Contact us soon, as our Burning Man 2017 calendar is filling fast.",

We'll talk thoroughly about safety, where you can hit, where you should stay away from, and cover the basics on several techniques. We'll talk about how you can begin to explore and have fun with this visceral and raw form of play safely (and without requiring medical care later). This event is adults only: 18+",

    "description": "Making drinking plans for your camp? Do those plans include lots and lots of aluminum cans? Want to unload all those empty cans on playa while also helping the kids of Gerlach? \r\n\r\nWell then come on down to Recycle Camp and SHOW US YOUR CANS! At Recycle Camp we will take all of your aluminum cans of your hands as part of our gift to the playa. We are located directly behind the Center Camp Café on 6:00 and are open every day 9am to 5pm. Please no drop offs: participate! When you get there, we will help you quickly separate your cans before riding THE CRUSHINATOR, our magical bicycle-powered can crushing apparatus that crushes your cans flat so we can store as many as possible before scrapping the aluminum off-site. All of the money we generate from aluminum recycling is donated directly to the Gerlach school system. Everybody wins!\r\n\r\nWe can only accept ALUMINUM cans. Please no glass, plastic, steel, or tin cans, so please keep all of your water bottles, tetrapaks, soup cans, and coconut waters separated. A good rule of thumb for figuring out if something is aluminum: if you can't crush it by hand, then we don't want it! Some stout beers like Guinness also have a plastic widget inside that cannot be recycled with the aluminum, please remove it beforehand or we can show you how. \r\n\r\nPROTIP from the Recyclenaut Aluminati: bring a MESH bag to collect all of your cans in. Plastic garbage bags don't allow your cans to dry out and create a foul, sticky sludge.

    "description": "Rituals Arts Collective's 'Sailing the Dead Seas: Rockin' the Boats!' installation is anchored in our childhood; you'll see a flotilla of oversized, whimsical, origami-like colorful 'paper boats,' each floating upon its 'waves.' Each boat is actually a teeter totter, ready to be rocked by the participants. As every craft has environmental sensors installed within, you'll hear incredible, albeit low-key musical tones, as 'played' by the wind, and motion of the boats. The effect is bio-elemental, aural soothing of our minds. Participants will find the interior of the (easily accessible) boats gilded in silver and gold, filled with inspirational quotes to complete the experience. Each ship/shrine has materials to write 'notes of hope' and means of containing these utterances by attendees (Truth be told, these boats act as walk-aboard shrine(s) to inspire Burning Man attendees to leave notes for us to burn off-playa in a ceremony, so their wishes may be granted to the winds after the Burning Man event. ;) The reason for 'Dead Seas' in the title is twofold: the playa's dry lake bed, and the actual Dead Sea in Jordan-- both have high mineral content, that which nourishes souls who 'float' in it. \r\n\r\nThat’s NOT all! ;o)\r\n\r\nThere be CHRISTENINGS, Ye Mateys! Help us christen our boats at the Playa Art Park and on the Playa itself!\r\n\r\nMonday, 1:00 pm: \r\n\r\nOur lead ship will be christened, and bubbly cider and water will be served to all #Land Pirates that attend! (But of course, bring yer cups and while supplies last! ;)\r\n\r\nTuesday, 1:00 pm: \r\n\r\nOur first flotilla of ships on the playa will be christened, and bubbly cider and water will be served to all #Land Pirates that attend! (But of course, bring yer cups and while supplies last! ;)\r\n\r\nWednesday, 1:00 pm: \r\n\r\nOur second flotilla of ships on the playa will be christened, and bubbly cider and water will be served to all #Land Pirates that attend! (But of course, bring yer cups and while supplies last! ;)",

No experience necessary nor do you need to arrive with a partner.  A caller walks the dancers through each dance before the music starts (with the dances lasting about 15 minutes).  Each dance is a (different) repeating sequence of relatively simple moves.  Hooting and stomping and a tribal vibe, where the Zen is playfulness, flow, synchrony, and bonding (not footwork, not competition).  If you are smiling, you are doing it right.  Kid friendly.  Possible for many disabled.   Everyone who shows up should have a good time.  Videos at the website.  You can  square dance all over the US  (and a smattering of other countries) in dance halls with up to a thousand people.  But the Playa makes it special so you should try it with us first!",

No experience necessary nor do you need to arrive with a partner.  A caller walks the dancers through each dance before the music starts (with the dances lasting about 15 minutes).  Each dance is a (different) repeating sequence of relatively simple moves.  Hooting and stomping and a tribal vibe, where the Zen is playfulness, flow, synchrony, and bonding (not footwork, not competition).  If you are smiling, you are doing it right.  Kid friendly.  Possible for many disabled.   Everyone who shows up should have a good time.  Videos at the website.  You can  square dance all over the US  (and a smattering of other countries) in dance halls with up to a thousand people.  But the Playa makes it special so you should try it with us first!",

As a first generation East Indian woman, physician, and mystic, I have battled through my own psyche to find clarity that I revere as a guide for my being in this world.  The spiritual crisis has been a fundamental struggle, as my life has been a search for identity in a new culture that clashes fiercely with that of my native heritage.  While India is vibrant with with fragrance, texture, sound, and color, a constant sensory exploration,  America has been overworked and desensitized by violence, oppression, ignorance, and suffering.  Initially a victim of this plight, Great Spirit ultimately granted the gifts of True Wisdom.  However, integration from the expansive awakening of unity consciousness to the mundane experience of ordinary life is no small task.  From the strength of humanity and the love of true friendships to miracles and the cosmic vibration found in the echoes of stillness, this is a story of that wonderful journey.",

All that remains are ancient artifacts used by the inhabitants in radical rituals.  \r\n\r\nWe don’t understand where or when these sacred artifacts came from or what they mean.  But they have been recovered from the sands of time… and we are inexplicably drawn to these objects… we worship them. \r\n \r\nAs a rite of passage, pilgrims from all over the playa flock to the Towers of Atlantis for a week once a year to worship the sun god.  The unbearable intensity of his sight will be shaded by a pleasing geometric covering that will be a gathering spot for deep house music dance rituals and the imbibing of tasty spirits.\r\n\r\nJoin us in our radical ritual!",

    "description": "As above, so below: maps of the Internet look like maps of the inter-species symbiosis in a forest, which look like maps of the functional connections in an LSD-inspired brain. And evidence is stacking up that psychoactive plants have played a major role in the development of language, art, and culture – not just for human beings, but across the biosphere.  \r\n\r\nAnd as within, so without: the dragons on the edge of our maps are turning into Pokémon in AR gaming; our science fiction narratives of de-extincted dinosaurs are looking likelier each day with radical advances in genetic engineering.  \r\n\r\nThanks to the psychedelic (\"mind manifesting\") power of our Promethean technologies, our dreams and fears have never been so fast to manifest as they are now.  It is time for us to take a long, hard look at what might be, if ANYTHING is possible. \r\n\r\nWhat did the psychedelic revolution of the 1960s teach us about how to handle the immense and terrifying pace of change these days?  Tim Leary said PCs would be the next LSD – and, in fact, it was their visionary journeys that they thank for inspiration, almost all the masterminds of the computing revolution.  So maybe there is something to the notion that the insights from psychedelic psychotherapy and of indigenous plant medicine traditions are just what the doctor ordered to help navigate this age's waves of great accelerating transformations.  \r\n\r\nJoin paleontologist-futurist Michael Garfield on a whirlwind tour through an age \"indistinguishable from magic\" – and a lighthearted but deadly serious examination of the responsibility of bringing new life forms and minds into this world as parents in our psychedelic century.\r\n\r\nWatch Michael's lightning presentation of this talk at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Innovation Lab:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfjnWkDwYrc\r\nView the slideshow for this talk:\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/tech-ethics-as-7956513",

    "description": "'The Divine Masculine and Feminine Healing Circle' is an event where the men of the playa are invited to step into their higher selves, and consciously hold the energy of the Divine Masculine. Josie Posie leads a ceremony where the women of the playa welcome the men lovingly at the entrance to the dome, inviting them to match the high vibration they hold. The dome becomes an Ancient temple space. The men then stand in a circle offering unconditional love and healing to the community of women who gather in the center. The women come for healing their trust of the Masculine and to receive their love. This is a hands-off workshop. There is no touching except optional hugging at the end. When men show up and become the pure presence of their Divine Masculine nature and truly witness, then women can relax into their loving Divine Feminine nature and fully become that love. As both polarities open to their Divine essence, we transmute cultural wounds in the collective feminine and masculine for all of humanity, co-creating a needed and beautiful new story of balance.",

Taking motivation from this year's Burning Man theme, we thought we would tap into a the Radical Ritual and play with a fun concept...\r\n\r\nStarting the day with spirituality, we end the day with incredible music. After leaving the first new moon of spring behind, we finalised our program and created a daytime/nighttime 12 hours program of our dreams.\r\n\r\n12:00 - 13:00\r\nWe start the day with our community college. We are constantly attracting new roads to explore. We hear friends talk about life changing experiences. We read articles on different ways of life. It leads to so many questions. What is ayahuasca? Should I do Vipassana? Why does Sting love tantric sex? Our community college invites inspirational speakers to provide information on interesting topics. Join this talk, be inspired or just listen to the many wonders of the world.\r\n\r\n13:00 - 14:00\r\nAs we gather in the desert for more than a week, we take the opportunity of this event to ground you, in the desert. Take a moment to step away from the outside world and connect with your home. A beautiful guided meditation accompanied by a celestial communication followed by a cleanse. Not only will this spiritual ceremony set the energy for the rest of our day, it will offer you so much light the rest of the week.\r\n\r\n14:00 - 00:00\r\nAs we slowly move from our spiritual self into our spiritual animal, we've created a musical program to get those who are passing by stop and dance. Our camp members are completely transformed into wild performers, face painters, tantric masseuses and more.",

In a hint of what is to come, those who find themselves in the path of the sidhe court first smell and taste the dusty grit of death and rebirth. Then they hear a pounding beat that heralds the bursting of the court from the Otherworld. Bystanders soon see a dark figure with pulsing veins of red light, curling horns, and a silver face that reflects a person’s soul back at them, followed by cavorting figures who tap rhythms on a variety of drums. \r\n\r\nIn a twisted caricature of the Pied Piper leading children astray, some of the aes sidhe beat a march for the procession, while other figures dart amongst onlookers, drawing bystanders into the procession as the group strides toward ritual stations of drums and light. The court – and its newly found attendants – pound a rhythm as the sun sinks below the horizon towards the inevitable transition, and transformation, from light to dark. The dark sidhe and its new court howl in joy as the glowing orb disappears beyond the skyline, welcoming the blessed cool of night.\r\n \r\nThe aes sidhe are looking for you to join our procession. Every dusk we will travel from our home at the ¡Bang! Tower to esplanade as we greet the dark in an expression of drumming, primal howling, and whatever else you can think up. The Gloaming procession will draw Black Rock City’s citizens to our 32 stations of drum and light placed around Esplanade. Join us as a spirit of the dark in a drumming celebration of sundown. \r\n\r\nIf you want to join us, link up with our Facebook group [https://www.facebook.com/BANGtribe/], email us, or swing by the 30-foot tall ¡Bang! Tower at the Baconeers Camp at 4:15 and Dance.",

Informational/experiential workshop for couples with at least one female!\r\n\r\nInspired by Naomi Wolf's Vagina (her book, not the real thing). So if no-one's told you, or you haven't noticed yet, men and women are different! Just how different, particularly in sexual response, is only recently being discovered by western science. The famous study of sexuality in the swinging sixties by Masters and Johnson was largely about male sexuality and in a stunning failure of the scientific method they kinda assumed women were pretty much the same......\"\"two arms, two legs, a head, yeah, I think they're pretty much going to react the same way....\"\" without actually finding out until 50/60 years later!\r\n\r\nBut there are and have been more enlightened cultures than ours on these matters. It turns out that some eastern cultures had got a very detailed handle on female sexuality thousands of years ago. Ancient tantric teachings turn out to be not a set of arcane practises based on spiritual mumbo jumbo but precise systems of activating the fullness of the feminine sexual response, now being verified by the latest research in neuroscience in the west.\r\n\r\nWolf calls this range of specific stimulations the Goddess Array, and I shall attempt to describe the steps that every woman needs that men don't need and create a container for you to experience the majority of them in one of Naked Heart's carpeted domes. \r\n\r\nPlease bring nesting materials and a secret gift for your goddess.",

They will address the importance of divestment from the Dakota Access Pipeline, the spiritual basis of the environmental crisis, and the role of politics and organizing and securing justice for Native communities. These two internationally-known lawyers will announce a call to action: petitioning the North Dakota Attorney General to drop charges against all water protectors and instead file charges against Tiger Swan, the private security company operating without a permit at Standing Rock, identifying water protectors as similar to \"jihadist terrorists\", and colluding with state and federal law enforcement to violate the civil rights of peaceful protestors.",

Six years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss. Lines are shortest early in the week, and early in the day.",

    "description": "Cultural appropriation is a topic that brings heated debate nearly every time it’s mentioned. Quite often, ignorant westerners who were raised to purchase meaning on a shelf or through a TV set can trigger sensitivities within traditional or sacred cultures, while at the same time individuals that seek in earnest to experience authentic meaning by transcending that very same commercial culture are easily stereotyped as insensitive or as frauds. The word “shamanism,” for example, is taken for granted and thrown around casually in festival culture, and yet who can agree on what it truly means in our context or who it legitimately offends?\r\n\r\nWe’ll uncover the complex history of this term while exploring a vision for planetary culture that integrates the profane and materialistic west with the sacred magic of the indigenous and the archaic. The story of the west is surprisingly rich with culture heroes (including the Cacophony Society and Suicide Club groups that Burning Man emerged from) that point the way towards a rich and meaningful cultural future, despite the overwhelming totality of capitalism. In fact, in the development of a global psychedelic culture, the world market has actually paved the way for a diverse confluence of neo-tribal adaptation and integration much the same way as the Romans built the roads that ultimately spread Christianity. Authentic cultural appropriation is the way forward and superficial cultural appropriation is a natural evolutionary byproduct.",

Many of us have engaged in sensual touch with a lover or tickling at a young age, but are you aware of how well the two can work together to make an amazing sensory experience with someone? Whether it is tickling to tears, to moans of delight, or simply squirming Domme Kelli Lynn Sage and Bagelfather are well versed in this and will be leading this class in sensual touch and the art of tickling with a partner. We have learned the ropes over the years and want to pass our wisdom on to you. We will instruct you, with the help of audience volunteers, in the art of tickling and sensual touch. \r\n\r\nWe will also cover consent, basic bondage, negotiation, safe words, having a positive relationship with kink, as well as touching. This event is for those 18 years old and over (please bring your ID if you look young). People of all gender identities are welcome to attend. It is best if you can come with a partner so you can practice some of what you learn, if you come alone we cannot guarantee to partner you up with someone. We recommend bringing a towel or something similar to lay on the ground to sit on. In addition we ask that you be respectful of all participants and remind you to ask before touching someone that you have not made arrangements before hand.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to volunteer ahead of time email Bagelfather@gmail.com, also feel free to let us know before we start if you are interested in demonstrating.",

You will learn some useful tools that can maximize our experience, as well as what we can learn in those inner voyages. Non- ordinary states of consciousness can come with their own sets of 'superpowers', operating principles and potential pitfalls. Knowing how to use those forces for expansion and alignment can not only occasionally save you from 'the inner gates of hell', but also bring accelerated growth, ecstatic experiences and a deep feeling of connectedness with yourself, others and the world.",

This is often because the questions you’ve always wanted to ask, are taboo; making it difficult to learn, understand, and honor the transgender path. Women/Trans identified only please.                                                                                     \r\n\r\nTrans 301: Dropping the Veil.\r\nWe will bare our souls and our bodies for visual inspection and further Q&A.\r\n\r\nTrans 401: Shredding the Veil.\r\nFor those brave audience members, we will open ourselves to not only visual review, but hands on, or hands in, examination. \"",

    "description": "Transfoamation is an interactive perfoamance camp which prompts citizens of BRC to ponder self-awareness and investigate the sources of their identity through the examination of perspectives on gender, sociofomo status, race and privilege.  Set in a post Refoamation environment, our theme from last year which asked people to confess their environmental sins to animals and experience life behind bars, this year’s Transfoamation involves a multi-stage process developed in conjunction with LGTBQ community which will highlight person-to-personal exercises diving into identity as participants queue up. After completing all prefoamation rituals to join our Tranfoamation they will shed their old dusty selves and clothing, enter our transfoam chamber, and ascend to the final stage of their actual Transfoamation to oneness with the universe and their fellow human in the transblastive foam experience. \r\n\r\nTransfoamation will take place daily starting on Wednesday and ending on Saturday at 12:00 -1:00pm for children under 13, 1:00 - 4:20pm for all people of all ages. We are usually located near 2:15/G. \r\n\r\nTransfoamation is also the home base of an amazing community that services the city 24 hours a day in a number of ways.  Besides the wonder of a daily personal Transfoamation we offer, the camp serves as the home base of the volunteer professionals working with the Zendo project that provides psychological harm reduction services across the BRC.  We host trainings for Zendo staff in our camp and run a 400 plate per meal kitchen connected to the Transfoamation and Zendo.  We will have a midday hydration area at the exit of our Transfoam Dome run by our camp as well. Also part of the Transfoam camp is the Abraxas Mutant vehicle team.\r\n\r\nOur camp changes it's name every year. Previous years we have been called Refoamation, Something Freaky This Way Foams, Fauxmirage, UFOm, Faux Mitzvah, Foamo Aragato, and Foam Saves.",

    "description": "\"Unfucking Sexuality is about decoupling the sex-craving instincts from the desire to connect intimately. Infinite openness awaits your surrender.\r\n\r\nWhen we can separate our desire for sex from our desire to connect intimately, a canvas of possibility emerges in the space between two hearts where we can truly explore intimacy as art.  \r\n\r\nHuman beings need touch, comfort, safety, love, and intimacy in their lives to feel whole, welcome, complete, and content. Attaining the combination of this cocktail of bliss often is only experienced through a sexual relationship of some kind, and rarely are all of these needs met simultaneously, or by the same person. \r\n\r\nOften, along the path to deepening a relationship or flirtatious connection, one partner or the other begins to dabble with sexual energy through flirting, playful touch, sexy talk, innuendo, or other strategies in an effort to shift the situation into an opening for sexual connection and orgasmic release. \r\n\r\nSexual energy is incredibly powerful, playful, blissful, and transformative, yet it can also be overwhelmingly tricky and even deceitful to one's self and others if not stewarded with care. \r\n\r\nThis workshop explores the fine lines between sexuality and intimacy, between loving touch and sexual touch, and between desire to be with someone intimately and the desire to fuck. \r\n\r\nThrough practicing clear and open communication, bringing awareness to the energy in our bodies and intention in our hearts, and by relaxing into the openness of the moment and surrendering any agenda for where it may be leading, the relational space can be transformed into a mysteriously infinite void of possibilities where literally anything can happen. \r\n\r\nCountless women have confided in me that they are frustrated beyond measure by their partner's (or men in general's) inability to be with them in a way that makes them feel safe, free to express their fullness, and feel loved, cherished, and comfortable in their bodies.",

    "description": "Jason Gore runs an executive coaching firm for fast-growing startups.  They firm primarily work with highly-innovative companies that will reshape a given industry or domain.  \r\n\r\nMany of their clients are young engineers who suddenly found themselves leading large teams.  They needed to learn what “good leadership” was, identify their blind spots, practice new communication skills, and improve their ability to lead.  After conducting 100s of leadership assessments, the firm has been able to scientifically define what good leadership is when it comes to building teams and innovating in the startup environment.\r\n\r\nIn this interactive presentation, Jason, the firm's cofounder, will share some of their discoveries, how leadership can be defined, and most-importantly, how what we learn by co-creating in community turns out to be the exact same skills that leaders are learning at startups.  \r\n\r\nFestivals like Burning Man are more than just a good time—they are a training ground for leaders, community, and innovation. There’s a reason that many startup leaders go to Burning Man and other festivals. \r\n\r\nTogether, we’ll look at what we have already learned about leadership though our community experiences and how to apply those skills to leadership in the default world.  Everyone in the audience will also receive a self-assessment (printed or online) to identify areas that they could improve.",

The next two hours involve a meditative sound practice, using sound, breath, and voice, combined with our imagination and intention, to create a warm and nurturing sonic space that enables us to quiet our minds and venture within. From there, we can explore deeper states of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe sounds of gongs, singing bowls, chimes, drums, and other instruments are not just heard through our ears, but are also felt by our bodies: our skin, bones, cells, and the fluids within us resonate with the sound’s vibrations. Sound can also trigger memories and emotions. Therefore, with focused listening and presence—by meditating on sound—we can work through underlying stress, release blocks, and bring ourselves into states of relaxation and well-being.",

Bonus points for being able to spin in place without losing your balance to transform into your alter ego. Women, do you need a little kinky revenge against men-kind? Learn about some safe and fun “painful practices” in a supportive, empowered environment. Men, pay homage to the superior sex from Paradise Island and have an opportunity to atone for the sins of men-kind by receiving punishments and participating in Amazon bondage games (confess your sins while tied in her golden lasso).

Born literally from a dream after returning from Burning Man about ten years ago, my vision embraced the core of the human body - the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine and the visible line of the Inguinal Ligament. A dream of dancers, hoopers, fire spinners and burners moving in every manner of human endeavor on the Playa and always the ASIS supporting the human form with such graceful, sensual strength. The Playa ASIS Project will attempt to capture the absolutely unique core of the individual in context of the Burning Man experience. This is not genital photography and we will limit identifying markers to your ASIS. Final artistic discretion will remain with the photographer.\r\nThis ASIS project will have a stationary location in our camp's community monkeyhut space on Tues. and Thurs. from 12pm to 2pm, but will also be roaming the playa with a photo wagon Mon., Wed. and Fri. Photos taken will be used for a anonymous encyclopedia of playa ASIS. Subjects will only be photographed if they choose to be part of the project. No records are kept on participants making the photos essentially anonymous.",
