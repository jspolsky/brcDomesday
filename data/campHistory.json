As kids, we naturally tested our limits for fun, but as adults, we often lose that instinct, turning movement into a means to an end rather than a source of joy. At Spinny's, playfulness reigns through mega-sized playground structures, type-2 fun experiences, and extreme schoolyard games hosted by our Recess Hall Monitors. From 360-degree see-saws and a spinning bar to rope climbs and dance floors, we invite burners to rediscover the thrill of movement on the playa. Created by a passionate crew of artists, engineers, and dreamers from Reno, Nevada. We don't stop playing because we grow old—we grow old because we stop playing.",

In the scene, 4 Tour de France cyclists, abducted by the mafia, are smuggled into an underground gambling ring. Each cyclist is put onto a bike-like machine in front of a crowd of bettors. Each machine drives a miniature statue; the faster the cyclist pedals, the farther the statue goes along the \"course\". In the film, whenever a statue falls behind, the cyclist powering him is \"taken out back\" and you hear a loud bang. \r\n\r\nWe'll be recreating this scene. You can ride up, hook up your bike, and see if you can get your horse to the finish line first. Any cyclists that fall behind will be \"taken out back\" and shot with a water gun.\r\n\r\nTo the side of the main event, we'll have a playa dome where cyclists can change into vintage jerseys. We'll even have an area for anyone who wants to shave their legs like a TRUE CYCLIST.",

        "description": "Apo-the-neum (place of divine elevation) is a visual, sonic and haptic instrument intended to \"transport\" visitors through participatory immersion. Comprised of two nested chambers made of back-to-back LED nets (13,940 nodes in all), Apotheneum presents multiple canvases for collaborating visual artists and an immersive sound system for collaborating sound artists. Measuring 40 x 40 x 40 feet, Apotheneum's cubic antechamber envelops a thirty-foot \"inner sanctum\" that opens to the sky and is anchored by a 24-foot pressure-sensing \"bed\" on which visitors are invited to recline, and be transported.\n\nAt night, evoking aspects of the natural world—wind, fire, lightning, rain, stars, gravity, people and animals—Apotheneum encourages inward contemplation through multi-sensory somatic immersion.",

Raindrops and eagle tears pour from the ceiling into a vast garden. With a turn of the control knob, the music slows and stretches, and the water begins to fall in slow motion. Real water drops, sparkling as they fall, slow and then hover in mid-air, each drop contorting before your eyes. If you find yourself stunned by the experience and would like to see it again, no worries -- you can reverse time by turning the knob the other direction, lift the water back into the sky, watch as it absorbs back into the eagles eyes, and then see the same drops fall again.",

Our lounge will be spinning tunes for every taste throughout the day. Our DJ sessions will be during sunset and, it's a more intimate experience, with a smaller 20x20 dance floor and smaller 600‐watt sound. We will have our 6th annual Super Hero Underwear Monkey Party with tasty monkey juice at our Monkey Bar. Throughout the week, we will keep the playa charged up with our fruit charging stations and entertained with our giant black light twister board. Three nights during the week we will have set Guest DJ's for our sunset parties and organize themed twister game nights. We are also holding a light saber battle to quench our thirst for swinging big sticks around.  With a large community shade structure we invite anyone to stop by and chill for a bit, get out of the sun, and meet new friends, any time of the day.",

We took a lot of inspiration from the Book of Tea written in 1906 by Okakura Kakuzō of Japan in English, he addressed the growing concern of clash between the east and west cultures.

Consult the crystal balls, visit the Witchdoctor of Oz, cuddle in the Munchkinland Lounge, partake in a farcical fashion show or shadow dance at The Flying Monkey pub… As darkness falls, the camp glows green peaking at our annual Thursday Midnight party where we fuse the Wizard of Oz with Dark Side of the Moon and the random insanity that is Burning Man.

        "description": "The Whomp Wagon, Jimmy's origins are sketchy. Legend has it that he was the main ride used by the most popular beat boys of the 1800's. Both DJ's, Lewis and Clark have been rumored to travel from settlement to settlement disrupting society with loud music. Jimmy eventually died of dysentery and the wagon was lost for years! Historians say the trail ended somewhere deep in the Nevada desert! THE WHOMP IS BORN, Found in the deep playa under a cloud of Dust, Dirty Beats & Lasers The Whomp Wagon was born! THE FUTURE The Whomp Crew now pushes our journey into the future with one inclusive vision: To create a platform where musicians of all genres can perform and share their gift for everyone. Burning Man changed our lives for the better and forever! The Whomp Wagon is our gift to Burning Man!",
