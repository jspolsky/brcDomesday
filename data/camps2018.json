Complimentary T-shirts provided to participants. We also feature body stamp temporary tattoos . Stop by, make some art and get a tramp stamp.\r\n\r\nAdditional Activities:\r\nSunset Journey Home Table. Share your journey \"Home\" while enjoying an ice cold IPA. Our bar table has become a focal point for all to express themselves with marking pens, paint, pictures or gifting their stories for all who visit the camp. We found each person had a unique and fascinating story of their journey to the Playa (home) whether it was their tenth or first time.  We found these opportunities to express and share their journey's Home were fun, spiritual and often emotional.\r\n\r\nThe Music Box. What do you get when you cross a box full of second hand instruments and a Playa populated with wayward musicians?  A spontaneous magical, musical jam session! Come by and join in this event.",

Lines of couples flow through each other creating a bonding, playful, noncompetitive, beautifully geometric, community dance for all ages and skill levels.  There is no required footwork and contra is possible for many with disabilities.  If you are smiling, you are doing it right.  Everyone who shows up will have fun.

Before the gates open to the general public on Sunday, we will be available to support the artists as needed.  We will offer bottled water, canned healthy beverages such as juice or coconut water to artists as they are setting up.  If any of the artists need a camp, they are welcome to camp with us where they can share our space.  We would also like to gift dust masks which will be made by our members.  And we will have a very nice supplied first aid kit.  Also, Monday through Friday (10-4) will offer a Peace Camp stencil station in front of our camp.",

    "description": "The Lost Penguins have proudly been a theme camp since 2001.  Our founders dream was to establish a hospitality camp where all burners are welcome and made to feel at home.  We have expanded on that dream and are proud to welcome Burners into our Cafe in 2018. \r\n\r\nOur cafe as a place for burners to chill on our couches and seating and listen to music.  We emphasis hospitality and greeting burners into our cafe and serving wine and chocolate and snow cones and penguin pee (vodka and lemonade drink).   To go with this year's theme, we have our space ship and the Penguin oracle to answer all of burner questions.  We are a camp that provides space for musicians, poets and others at Open Mic times, and welcome burners who want to participate in an informal open mic and music experience.   We have music equipment set up or bring your own.  Burners who are musicians can check in with our Entertainment lead and schedule time to perform.    And music is scheduled throughout the day and night.",

    "description": "Ukraine is very radical: we have gone through Chernobyl, we gave this planet its largest aircraft and two Klitschko brothers. It is important for us to introduce Ukraine as radically good. This means that we should dispense with references to our radical achievements, but don't go unnoticed! \r\n\r\nCossacks, our heroic ancestors, really loved to fight. When the opportunity arose, the Cossacks gathered from all over Ukraine in a secret place and organized their life in a very strange way: think of something between a pirate's lair and the Shaolin monastery. \r\n\r\nAs burners do, Cossacks from different regions of Ukraine settled camps together, and each camp was called 'Kooren.' This ancient word is saved as the name of one of the most remote areas of modern Kyiv called Kurenivka. So we call our Ukrainian camp Kurenivka!",

Our lounge will be spinning tunes for every taste throughout the day. Our DJ sessions will be during sunset and, it's a more intimate experience, with a smaller 20x20 dance floor and smaller 600‐watt sound. We will have our 6th annual Super Hero Underwear Monkey Party with tasty monkey juice at our Monkey Bar. Throughout the week, we will keep the playa charged up with our fruit charging stations and entertained with our giant black light twister board. Three nights during the week we will have set Guest DJ's for our sunset parties and organize themed twister game nights. We are also holding a light saber battle to quench our thirst for swinging big sticks around.  With a large community shade structure we invite anyone to stop by and chill for a bit, get out of the sun, and meet new friends, any time of the day.",

In the scene, 4 Tour de France cyclists, abducted by the mafia, are smuggled into an underground gambling ring. Each cyclist is put onto a bike-like machine in front of a crowd of bettors. Each machine drives a miniature statue; the faster the cyclist pedals, the farther the statue goes along the \"course\". In the film, whenever a statue falls behind, the cyclist powering him is \"taken out back\" and you hear a loud bang. \r\n\r\nWe'll be recreating this scene. You can ride up, hook up your bike, and see if you can get your horse to the finish line first. Any cyclists that fall behind will be \"taken out back\" and shot with a water gun.\r\n\r\nTo the side of the main event, we'll have a playa dome where cyclists can change into vintage jerseys. We'll even have an area for anyone who wants to shave their legs like a TRUE CYCLIST.",
