    "description": "Q: What's more awesome than a dance party in the desrt?\r\n\r\n\r\nA: A scavenger hunt desert dance party! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWait... what is a scavenger hunt dance party you ask? It's real simple! At random points during the dance party we'll pick a category like snowboard goggles. You'll then have to find a burner walking around with snowboard goggles and bring them to the dance party to score points before we move onto the next category. If you get them to join your team, you'll score an additional point per round until they leave. There is even a rumor going around that there could be secret bonus rounds! Teams of any size welcome! Outpost 23 DJs will be throwing down 90s, one-hit wonders and mash up to celebrate the occasion.",

The practice will last 30 minutes. The practitioner begins by quieting the overactive conscious mind, then moves into a meditative state called pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses), gradually finding a state of “ultimate harmony,” in which the brain waves slow down and a subtle euphoria emerges.",

Coconut currency anyone? John Frum?\r\n\r\nLearn the secret lost in the Garden of Eden that money grows on trees. It is the secret hidden from us by the serpent viper money changers. Learn how to destroy all fiat currency and turn it into gods money. Time, technology and resource based currencies.\r\n\r\nLearn how you can convert your fiat currency into food based currency thus returning the fiat to the bankers who printed it and leaving you with an actual valuable commodity to spend into the economy.\r\n\r\nIts simple you purchase a bag of grain from a local producer only they agree to store it for you and you get the receipt to trade for other goods or services. Now you have a pure resource based currency. It has more intrinsic value than fiat as it can be eaten. \r\n\r\nThe receipt for the goods must be claimed by a certain date to be valid as the product has a shelf life and the grower storing the grain has to pay for storage. The receipt has the value of the grain paid in dollars and denotes the weight the receipt is good for.\r\nThe receipt can be traded for the fiat currency value or the weight value.\r\n\r\nIn this way any agricultural community can regain control of their money supply.\r\n\r\nMay peace be with you,\r\nJoshua",

We will start to gather at 11pm after the regional burn and begin the performance at 11:59pm Thur 8-29, creating the first Midnight Mass Windphony, ever in the history of humankind! \r\n\r\nThe plan is to create a human / color-light & sound vibrational bridge connecting the Man, the Temple and Way Beyond (what ever that means for you) through a vibrational alignment of individual players. We are inviting conscious hoopers, fire dancers and any other  \"instruments of mass creation\" to sync up with this vibrational field of PEACE & LOVE. This is the only pre-requisite for BAND Members, as we open a \"Quantum Portal\" bridging our highest potential, creating a \"morphogenic field,\" reaching inter-dimensionally through time and space, connecting all those attuned to this vibrational field.\r\n\r\nCome and Play...even if you are not on the Playa, join us on a vibrational level...and if you do make it, ONLY COME IF YOU CAN HOLD A POSITIVE THOUGHT OF LOVE AND PEACE! We will create a cosmic \"string of pearls\" that will produce a universal ripple...reaching Eternity ItSelf! This IS Cult Cargo at its finest, with only our highest and best intentions in mind, as we collectively \"reach out and touch some ONES...\" And if the time and space permits...maybe, just maybe, the recipients of our Mass Windphony will come and  join us in this 3rd dimensional reality... with the veils already thinned  through the very spirit of Burning man...anything is possible! \r\n\r\nCome Play in the Band and help create this cosmic wave...\r\n\r\nRegister at https://www.facebook.com/windsingerX and if you want to be part of the Windphony. Bring a Windsinger, or let us know if you want to own an instrument of your own, as part of our non-profit Windsinger Xperience!",

ALIA transmits the bliss she experiences in performances to create a connected, alive and activated experience that evokes the sacred and awakens our connection to our source through rhythm and movement. She approaches every set as a ritual and as a facilitator of dance floor unity. ALIA has shared the stage with the likes of Beats Antique, Random Rab, Govinda, Freq Nasty, Marty Party, An-ten-nae, Heyoka, Pussymonster, Sasha Rose, Vibesquad, DJ Jocelyn, and Bay Area favorite DJ Dragonfly.

The purpose is to bring us back to our most natural state of being, with the desert environment and red hands symbolizing life and death, love and hate. The more participants the better, helping to create a unifying and liberating experience which will be documented with photography and film, to be posted on the website Bodypaintography.com. Look for flags with Red Hands and buckets that need help filling! Lets make this gathering impressive and expressive together! Don’t forget to bring water for hydration.\r\nWhen: The happening takes place 3pm dusting preparation, 5 pm documenting the outcome.\r\nWhere:  Meet near the Temple…look for the flags with Red Hands!",

    "description": "This is a workshop focused on the current skies from a Western Astrology perspective. The biggest news is the ongoing Uranus - Pluto square, which is coming up again in early November. The revolutionary and evolutionary symbolism of this collision of outer planet energies is evidenced all around us, for both the society in general and for individuals. It represents in fact the hallmark of the sixties, when they were last in major aspect; then they were conjunct. Coincidentally - not! - the first exact hit if this current square was last year, in 2012... we have been seeing increasing signs of the return of sixties idealism and sexual freedom, women's empowerment, folks out in the streets to protest an establishment that has truly run amok, and on and on... this important outer planet aspect in fact colors this entire decade that I like to call the \"turbulent teens...\" Planned to be an hour-long discussion/talk with plenty of time for questions...",

If you're interested in learning more about how to please your man orally, this is the place for you.\r\n\r\nCome on ladies / givers, you know you've got some skills - and some questions!  Come share your favorite tips and techniques by words and demonstration, and ask questions that have been plaguing you.\r\n\r\n\t* Drool or dry? \r\n\t* What about the gag reflex?\r\n\t* How do you use hands and still go deep?\r\n\r\nAnd guys, you must have comments you'd like to pass on, other than simply \"Yes, please\"!\r\n\r\n\t* Hate teeth?  Want teeth?\r\n\t* What about deep throat?\r\n\r\nHere's your chance to make your requests - and pet peeves - heard!\r\n\r\nThis is a participatory event open to couples of any combination, so long as one of them has some phallic protuberance and the other is applying lips, tongue, and maybe even throat to it.  No lookie-loos!\r\nThis was a great fun event at the last Burn.  The presenter's been researching all year to find new tidbits and info to share.  (Hey, someone's gotta do the tough jobs.)

The Burning Man event, like no other environment in the world, has created a unique venue for art, and has rekindled one of art’s most valuable functions: connecting community members in creation, curiosity, and wonderment. At Burning Man, we observe how art brings people together, inspires participation and engenders meaningful connections between individuals. The art experienced at Burning Man invites individuals to interact with both the work itself and with their community at large.\r\n\r\nBRAF was established to bring this modality of creating and coexisting with art to the rest of the world, with the vision that community-driven, inclusive, and interactive art is vital to a thriving culture. The foundation received its 501(c)3 status in November of 2001. Come learn more and see how  you can get involved.",

    "description": "Bobby Wheelock needs 32 volunteers to help deliver the Funpack flyers to every burning man participant. Deliver 2000 flyers and get much schwagg. -------\r\n\r\nYes,  Bobby Wheelock has finally worked out how to give back to every participant on the playa.  This will encompass delivering 64,000 unique flyers to everyone.  And we need YOU to help. --------\r\n\r\nUpon taking this great privilege,  you will zig zag down the streets and give flyers to all participants - and these are not your normal flyers.  Each one is different, unique, and special.  There are jokes, puzzles, games, gags, and coupons, and ultimately a higher purpose - to make sure every burner gets the true value of decommodification.  These flyers are also very well organized so as to tell  participants everything they need to know - their new Playa name, color, home planet and more!\r\n------\r\nTo participate,  Please wait at your most convenient corner on the outlying road of Laissez-faire on wednesday morning, and look for the mutant vehicle with a big Z on it. \r\nWe will provide you with a bag full of a chunk of flyers, a map with directions, a official postal cap, and a second bag so you can collect all the gifts that are Deserved to you by the populace of Burning Man for your amazing volunteer effort.  The routes will be back and forth from each 1/2 hour street, moving inward from Laissez-faire to the Esplanade.\r\n------\r\nHelp us with this amazing performance art project.  Help us ensure that Decommodification stays as a true principal!\r\n------\r\nWho is Bobby Wheelock?\r\n\r\nBobby is one of the earliest human clones.   Born in 1970,  he is duplicated from the DNA of a prominent German political leader.  That being said,  Bobby has veered away from his \"father's\" ways and wishes to bring love joy to the burning man community.",

Start the week off feeling fabulous about yourself with a playlist that includes Queen Latifah, Li'l Kim, Salt-N-Pepa, DJ Kool, Notorious BIG, A Tribe Called Quest and much more! Come and shake what your mama gave you and don't feel bad about it for one second. These are your people, you big beautiful burner!\r\nThere will be an art video/photo project being created, for posting on the internet after the event, which shows all of the variety of bodies we radically accept on the playa, not just the models that can make the director's cut for the \"Places you'll go\" video. Come and get your body painted as our artist sees fit and take a step to show off your radical self love!\r\nThere will be Sonoma County Sangria served at the Thirsty Camel bar and a multi-media dance extravaganza inside the dome.

But at the Black Rock City Museum of Transportation History, we explore the fictional story of fictional transportation in a fictional historical Black Rock City.  Learn about how burners got around the Playa before bikes ruled and art cars amazed.  See pictures, models, and artifacts gathered since Black Rock City's fictional founding nearly 150 years ago.  Hear from a guide, or if we're not around, take a self-guided tour.  Perhaps most importantly, tell us your own stories, or perhaps your grandmother's, about BRC's fictional transportation past!\r\n\r\nWe'll be open during the day (lunchtime to dinnertime) starting on Monday.  Our big gala takes place on Wednesday night at 9pm--it's Burner black tie.  Come find us on 9:00 near Desiderata!  Hope to see you.",

Come join in an interactive workshop that will explore the shadow side of John Frum including the negative impact of colonialism, the glorification of material objects, the destruction of native lands and culture, America's lack of responsibility for military endeavors, and the current impact of this Cargo Cult story. This workshop will explore our shared reality of how racism, classism, and sexism affect our current Burning Man community. We welcome people of all backgrounds to this workshop and to this exploration of how the oppression we were taught in every day society plays out on playa. We will explore the difficulties of the current paradigm and how that affects our ability to form a new experimental community. There will be space to address how we as the BM community want to create change on and off playa.",

You've seen feats of skill on the Playa, and who hasn't dreamed of running off to join the Circus. Heck, half of y'all probably still dream in acrobats and clowns.  At Circus Boot Camp, we'll teach you to juggle, unicycle, hoop, slack line, trapeze, crack a whip and indulge your childish fancy in other circus-inspired arts.\r\n\r\nI know what you're thinking: \"Sure, you'll teach me to juggle... after I've spent years on the road washing elephants and dodging monkey poop!\" Wrong! Our goal is nothing less than to bring the joys of object manipulation, unicycling and other circus arts to the Playa masses in a casual, friendly and fully clothed environment (ok, mostly-clothed).\r\n\r\nAlready a circus pro? Come test your mettle on our slackline; dance your clown shoes through the obstacles of irony; pass clubs with seasoned semi-professionals; try your hand at the Valley of One-Wheeled Doom!!",

    "description": "The Tetrion Spaceport\r\n\r\nA very long time ago, Aliens came to this planet and built a spaceport. They brought in spaceships with supplies, did a little bit of genetic engineering and started what we know as modern civilization. Then they left without a trace. Without its force field, the spaceport reverted to basic elements. In other words, it dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe ancient people of that time did everything to try to call back the aliens and their spaceships. They built spaceports, called henges out of wood, to no avail. They even built a spaceport out of stone. Its remains can be found in Southern England and is known today as Stonehenge. Still no Aliens came. They were missing the technology they did not understand.\r\n\r\nWell, we have figured it out. They were missing a beacon. Without a Quantum Transducer acting as a subspace beacon the alien spaceships have nothing to home in on. Well, we have fixed that. We built one. In fact, the entire spaceport is one giant beacon, shining like a lighthouse in the subspace frequencies.\r\n\r\nAt 11:00 p.m. on Wednesday night, we will turn on our subspace Quantum Transducer. A spaceship will appear and Johnfrum will return to Earth. He will bring us a message of peace and friendship. He will once again return to Earth and live with us in harmony.\r\n\r\nWe will welcome him with wine, women, music and dance. So be at Camp Tetrion and its Spaceport for the festivities. This will be the real deal! Rejoice! Johnfrum will come back at long last!",

Our mission is to bring together artists, technologists, and designers that push the boundaries of hardware, software, and physical/digital mediums for one evening to play and share. Our ultimate goal is to leave our participants and audience with one of the most unique Art+Tech experiences. In the end we would love to see a seed of inspiration taking bloom in someone’s eyes and diffusing creative digital glow through their entire spirit. If you think you've got that special sparkle in you to inspire others, looking for the ways to get  inspired, or just want to play and hang around with like-minded people, join us on Tuesday, the 29th, after dusk at our camp Clusterf*uck United for the dimension of \" code\" me on The Playa experience.",

Half the moves are with your partner, half with everyone else - so it has a tribal vibe, where the Zen is flow, synchrony, and bonding (not footwork, not competition). The repeated cycles of movement give dancers a long time to catch on.  In any case if you are smiling you are doing it right.  Dancers adjust their behavior to each new dancer they come to and gently realign fellow dancers if needed making contradancing one of the most accessible group dance forms, with for example mentally disabled, blind, deaf and wheelchair bound dancers at many dances.  Friendly to children and adults carrying children.  Sunset - midnightish (later if everyone keeps going), except Sat starts 30 min after the man falls, Sun starts 60 min after the temple burn begins.

This year's configuration will see 4 circles of six effigies placed around the base of the Man that will burn together on Thursday night at exactly 9pm to create the world's largest intentional simultaneous Burn!\r\n\r\nGuided by the Ten Principles, CORE teams work together throughout the Spring and Summer to create art that celebrates their Regional identities and showcases the collaborative artistic efforts of their community members. The CORE Project is a celebration of Burning Man's Regional Network and of the work that groups throughout the world are doing to nurture and support the Burning Man ethos as a global cultural movement.\r\n\r\n2013's Circle of Regional Effigies will include the highest number of international Regional groups to date with groups from Taiwan, Israel, The Netherlands, Lithuania, Czech Republic, and France joining the circle.\r\nIf you are joining us on the playa, visit the Everywhere Pavilion on the Esplanade to get placement maps, and read more info about each effigy, meet with Regional Contacts and CORE artists and collaborators.\r\nIn the meantime, please read about the pieces on the Burning Man website, so you can understand them better, and enjoy them that much more during your time in BRC.\r\n\r\n•••Tour de CORE Monday 7-10pm•••\r\nThere will be a TOUR DE CORE Celebration of the Regional Effigies on Monday evening. This is the time to come out to the CORE project and visit with the creators and builders and see what they have to share with you about their projects. This is Black Rock City's moment to honor these groups for their exceptional work!\r\n\r\n•••LINKS•••\r\nCORE Burn: bit.ly/COREBurn2013\r\nTour de CORE: bit.ly/TourdeCORE2013\r\nStay updated on all things CORE: facebook.com/BurningManCORE\r\nRead up on the 2013 CORE Projects: burningman.com/installations/art_core.html",

As classes begin back home in San Francisco, we know there are many of us right here in Black Rock City. Instead of meeting in the halls to talk about how \"great the burn was this year,\" and how “we should meet up next year,” let's get together on the Playa to celebrate our amazing community and the unique institution that we call home. PCC Professor Richard Tarnas will give an enlightening talk on the historical role of “heroic communities” in transforming the world (like CIIS and Burning Man). Wear your best Playa fashions, bring your friends and family, and maybe even get some ideas for your next academic paper. Let’s elevate “school spirit” to a new dimension while we enjoy each other outside of our default roles. We’ll have some drinks, we’ll have some laughs, and we’ll dance with reckless abandon as we get ready to transform the (default) world.\r\n\r\nCOSMOCPOIA [address]\r\nTuesday, August 27, 8PM",

    "description": "We would like to invite you to POSE NUDE in a group photographic installation by artist Spencer Tunick.\r\n\r\nSpencer will choose men, women and any gender identity to be part of this unique installation.\r\n\r\nIn order to be chosen we ask that you please send in a low resolution photograph of yourself.\r\nParticipants will be selected based on photographs submitted to the email: \r\nprojects@spencertunick.com\r\nPlease send the image sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\nMost installations by Spencer do not have limits to the number of people participating, nor do they require the submission of a photograph. However, for this art work for Burning Man, there is a cap on the number of people participating due to the specific concept of the work.\r\nWe are asking for a photograph because we want to have a wide range of body types and skin tonalities represented in the final work. Although everyone is unique, If you are not chosen, it is simply because we may have reached the amount of people with similar specific characteristics. We apologize in advance if you are not chosen for this particular idea but please do not let it deter you from posing in future works by Spencer where there are no number limits.\r\n\r\nChosen participants will be contacted by email prior to August 24th with: location and further instructions. Please only sign up if you are committed to participating and able to wake up before sunrise (or stay up all night). The work will take place before sunrise in order to utilize the pre-dawn light. You will be in position when the sun rises.\r\n\r\nYou only will be nude for a short period of time. \r\n...we know it's chilly...so you will not be nude until right before the sun rises over the horizon and as the sun hits your body. 5am is just the call time to get you registered.  We need everyone to be on time.  In exchange for taking part, you will receive by mail, a limited edition print of the art work. PARTICIPANTS ONLY. \r\nThank-you!",

Dex Mex (¡Olé!) has since grown to include world-class DJ talent and has been heralded by many as “the best daytime party on the playa”. Sure, that could have been the tequila talking, but tequila knows a good party, so you should listen when it speaks.

If you’ve ever wondered about the compressive strength of a 10 day old loaf, make a point to come by and marvel at this free-standing enclosed structure. The material for this abode can be grown in one growing season and has an insulation value of R-5. The inspiration for this 10 foot diameter Dome of Dough is the traditional beehive shape of the charcoal kilns in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nCrawl inside, wonder at the meditative vibe and who knows, maybe there will be fresh bread and jam for snacking.\r\n\r\nWARNING: HI Gluten Zone!\r\n\r\nSubmitted by Howie Hawkes, AKA Hawkster, howie@hawkesconstruction.com",

You'll discover that you have all the resources you need to keep your body healthy and your mind at peace, using these simple, yet profound movements.  Jump, tap, shake, sway, and breath yourself into a state of tranquility & health.  There will be an emphasis on practical application; this is a workshop and ritual, not a lecture! All are welcome, especially beginners.  Open yourself to the magic coursing within. Qigong is much gentler than most forms of yoga, and a wonderful complement to a vigorous yoga practice. Both practices have a common source, Neolithic shamanism.",

Combined with the incredible power of the playa's only nuclear reactor, the Siberian Electric Company, the Electric Lazy Lounge is stronger than ever and now capable of transporting participants beyond this universe into other dimensions of time and space.  Not only is the Electric Lazy Lounge the only way to get to LazyLand, it’s truly the best seat in the house. It will be open nightly with the bar.",

His talent is pure. His passion is unmatched.\r\n\r\nThe 31 year old Far Hills native and William Paterson University music graduate has been the recipient of several positive reviews by prestigious critics and has been featured in the Star Ledger, New York Village Voice Magazine, New York Post, the ASPCA and a host of online blogs and pop culture media sites.\r\n\r\nHayes' credits include collaborating and performing with several big name artists such as Gavin Degraw, Martin Sexton, Bill Withers, Rusted Root, Indie artist Rachel Platten, Reggae legend Ziggy Marley and soul artist Joss Stone.\r\n\r\n2013 has been and continues to be an incredible year for Hayes. He is truly humbled by the invitation to perform and share his music at Burning Man 2013 on the night the \"Man Burns\" for Black Rock City and such an incredible community of artists.\r\n\r\nHayes is well known for his musical charity work and has headlined exclusive events held by some of the world’s most elite circles of hosts including the opening dinner ceremony for the United States Olympic Wrestling Team and headlining the internationally recognized American Giving Awards winning \"More Than Me\" charity. \r\nHe is inspired by both male and female artists including Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Miles Davis, Jimi Hendrix, Susan Tedeschi and Radio Head. Recently Hayes performed at the annual ASPCA fund raising charity event, attracting more than 15,000 people, during which he reportedly helped friend and animal advocate Prince Lorenzo Borghese raise more than $50,000 for animal welfare.",

It’s a fool’s errand to get the dust off them, but we try every year anyway. You too can be one of the sexiest clean freaks on the playa. Rendezvous with us! Please bring: non-feather dusters, rags, dustbusters, service carts, vacuums, white gloves, latex gloves, enema kits, lube, any other useful cleaning equipment, and your worst possible French accent. On Thursday at 2:00 pm we meet at 3 O’Clock and Esplanade then dust our way through every filthy, nasty camp on our march toward that dust bucket known as Center Camp Café, liberate them from their dusty oppression, and celebrate our triumph!",

    "description": "Holotropic Breathwork™ is a powerful approach to self-exploration and healing that integrates insights from modern consciousness research, anthropology, various depth psychologies, transpersonal psychology,\r\nEastern spiritual practices, and mystical traditions of the world. The\r\nname Holotropic means literally \"moving toward wholeness\" (from the\r\nGreek \"holos\"=whole and \"trepein\"=moving in the direction of something).\r\n\r\nThe process itself uses very simple means: it combines accelerated\r\nbreathing with evocative music in a special set and setting. With the\r\neyes closed and lying on a mat, each person uses their own breath and\r\nthe music in the room to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness.\r\nThis state activates the natural inner healing process of the\r\nindividual's psyche, bringing him or her a particular set of internal experiences. With the inner healing intelligence guiding the process,\r\nthe quality and content brought forth is unique to each person and for\r\nthat particular time and place. While recurring themes are common, no\r\ntwo sessions are ever alike.",

California is one of many Granges throughout the country that are supporting a return of agriculture to local farming, organics, sustainable practices, alternative energy and localization of living and working.  We actively support the arts, music, education, youth and engage in a variety of community service projects.\r\n\r\nCalifornia Grange is on the forefront of revitalizing this organization that was founded after the Civil War by family farmers who opposed domination by big banks and railroads that controlled markets and prices. \r\n\r\nCorporatocracy is ever more powerful and many Granges actively oppose it.\r\n\r\nCome learn about the Grange and how we work to create relevant communities whether urban or rural rooted in family and friendship.",

We will together invoke the Divine Feminine in Her profoundly deep, naked, authentic, healing, initiatic role in order to give birth to our cosmic, true nature.  We have been fascinated and passionately exploring the Art of the Sacred Union for years, studying the tantric teachings of Kashmir Saivism tradition, Kaula lineage, Dasha Mahavidya system, Sufi mysticism, sexual shamanism, and occidental esoteric alchemy and psychology.

These agents provided the transcendent space that allowed inner wounds to be reconfigured into a more manageable and workable form, releasing the soul from inner/outer conflict.\r\n\r\nExperiences with three different entheogenic agents enabled me to access states of consciousness that fostered healing in my familial relationships by re-framing conflicts, through form of visions and wider understandings, in pictorial, mythological, and transcendent narratives. These experiences in the Other Worlds have been translated into substantial and concrete shifts in the Ordinary World.\r\n\r\nThis journey through the ‘immaterial' considers entheogenic agents as psychological/emotional catalysts for transformation and growth. The Jungian framework of alchemy and individuation has been central in filtering my transformational process and the focus is on its relevance to integrating psychedelic explorations.",

Well we are crazy but you will soon understand why the trash fence sounds like rubbish to some and magic to others…\r\n\r\nWhy Burning Man? Crazy right!?\r\nWhy yes we are! And since BM is where we met, it seemed the most perfect place for us to get married. There is NO obligation to attend. If you can join us, we'd love to have you!

The 2009 version of this event won the Acculturation Video award from Burning Man (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtX8Z-izffs\\).

It comprises a new somatic modality for reanimating the body with its improvisatory flow and playful exploratory freedom. Supported on a massage table with your body borne aloft on the continually moving fulcrum of the practitioner’s body, the receiver is moved through a wide range of extended postures.  Using a suite of practiced movements, such as pivoting his body under different joints of your body, the giver is able to move the receiver seamlessly and weightlessly throughout the course a session. He safely levers the receiver’s body into increasingly extended and pleasurable positions that combine deep hip opening, pivoting and spinal decompression that, collectively, evoke a deep state of surrender.",

Using brainwave-oracles to channel mental energy, the supplicants invoke the Tesla-Jinn and energize the cargo ritual, producing a fiery prayer-ring-of-hands, circling overhead faster and faster, and as the coil begins to energize a hoary crown of high voltage discharge develops a dome of plasma, arcing and sparking wildly, as the electromagnetic prayer is transmitted out into the heavens, and as the transubstantiation is at zenith the distant sound of approaching Voices can be heard, building in volume as a host of heavily-laden, ground-shaking, cargo-bearing bird machines bears down on the encampment, growing louder and louder until the thunderous, throbbing drone of a chorus of engines shakes the tower and brings an eruption of devotional energy as precious cosmic cargo rains down upon the blessed worshipers of dust and fire. Weather permitting.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to strap on a brainwave \"oracle\" and watch the monitor as you control your brainwaves and fire the flame cannons, invoking the \"Cosic Cargo Routine\".\r\n\r\nBrain cleansing services may be available throughout the day but we cannot commit to being properly staffed except on the posted time and date.

Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye  \r\ncontact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and  \r\ncontagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a  \r\nscientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and  \r\nreal laughter.

However, not every prize is so great, oh yes there are zonks out there so choose wisely and listen to your fellow citizens shouting from the audience because they may think they know something that you don’t. If you’ve seen the popular television show that inspired this game show then you know what to expect. Have fun, participate, and stick the zonk to the other guy!

YOU! \r\nAnd we're here to fix that. Like a chiropractor who adjusts your body, we adjust your life emotionally, mentally and spiritually, helping you see what's holding you back and giving you the tools to create the life you want.\r\n\r\nCamp IMAGINEnation is a life coaching camp dedicated to the power of dreaming and radical honesty. Our Life Coaches are trained in The Handel Method and go through an extensive 2-year or more training process on life issues and human behavior. \r\n\r\nCamp IMAGINEnation was founded by The Handel Group and born of an authentic and ambitious desire to change the world in a very positive way. It is a spiritual endeavor for us. We think that those who are willing to dig deep and look at themselves honestly are the most courageous people in the world, not to mention, people we’d want to hang with. In a word, we are looking to make personal development cool. We think it is. \r\n\r\nThe Handel Method was developed over the last 15 years by HG Co-founder and Chairman, Lauren Zander. The method is the foundation for not only our life coaching work, but also for the courses we teach at MIT, NYU, Rutgers and Stanford Business Schools, and for the work we do within large companies in the Executive Coaching Division. The method is revolutionary yet easy to understand, methodical yet infinitely customizable. Most importantly of all, it has proven to be highly effective.\r\n\r\nTogether we dig deep, play big and don’t stop until goals are fulfilled and lessons learned. We care, we love what we do and we walk our talk.",

It is guarded by the Tree of Life, a \"palm\" tree with leafy hands outstretched to the sky.  Inside there is the blank Book of Life. Anyone who opens this mysterious book is greeted with the question “What is the meaning of life?” The Catch: your answer has to be in 5 words, no more no less. \r\nAnswers will be written within the book’s dusty pages throughout the week of Burning Man. Ravers, demons, and dusty pilgrims will stop to reflect and contribute their answers. It is a shared experience; anyone and everyone has access to the book.",

    "description": "The sun’s just up, but not too hot yet, but clothing is optional here,  so adults only, please. Come for an early hour of low impact exercise  in the Longevity Stick Art (LSA) discipline of 12 low-impact exercises  \r\nto build balance, flexibility, strength, mental focus, breathing capacity, and vitality, and open your points and channels. Bring your water or hydration liquid. We’ll have sticks available for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed the Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese Army. He helped his fellow  prisoners restore and maintain their health through LSA, and vowed that if he was ever freed, he would dedicate his life to spreading its benefits to the world, with the proviso that no future trainer could ever charge for the course. (Sounds like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, settled in Southern California, and started teaching classes of students and future teachers. Today, there are dozens of classes weekly around So Cal. Also, LSA is spreading around the US and world.  \r\nMany more details are available at:  HYPERLINK \r\n\"http://www.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html \" www.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html and  HYPERLINK \"http://www.filmbaby.com/films/2341 \"  \r\nMaster Dao passed away late 2010 at age 89, and I was privileged to attend his funeral, and his last birthday party, a few months before.",

Gravity central.Grounding is a vital component of daily balanced living. It allows us to deepen our connection with mother earth, or Gaia, and source energy. It teaches us how to release stress, stay focused, clear the chatter from our minds and auric fields, and eliminate free radicals from our bodies. When we connect with Gaia, we begin to realize that we are all safe and well provided for. We learn to understand our greater truths and to let go of fear, anger, guilt and anxiety. This allows us to establish a connection with our divine authentic self.\r\n\r\nWhether you are a seasoned meditator or novice, you are invited to experience an ancient Eastern meditation breathing technique that has been passed on from master to master for centuries to achieve self-enlightenment. In this workshop you will learn about the chakra system, with an emphasis on the root, sacral and solar plexus. Our chakras govern our life force energy as well as our glandular, mental and emotional systems. Through the use of sage, crystals and sound we will also start to understand basic cleansing of our auric field and our surroundings. We will utulize ancient grounding techniques and a guided meditation to establish our connection with Gaia, help transform our outlook, and feel more grounded in our everyday lives.",

It is the celebration of the masculine/feminine essence we enjoy so much!\r\n- Hair or Make Up will be available prior to the show for participants who show up early enough\r\n- A sense of rhythm helps but simply moving works just fine\r\n\r\nCome early and stay late for the Men's Lingerie Review in the Dungeon. Same models, sans outerwear. Models, bring your lace thongs, your hosiery, corsets and the pieces that make you feel sexy all under!\r\n\r\nDuring the shows, Retrofolic will offer delicious alcohol and non-alcohol beverages. Lights of color, art of goth and kink will treat your eyes. Music of tribal and trance, multiple scenes with howls of delight, moans of agony and screams of extremes will fill your ears in the 1600 feet squared dungeon space next door!",

According to wikipedia, Pure miso paste nutritional information: Although high in sodium (over 400% DV), one cup (275 g) of miso paste is an excellent source of dietary fiber (59%) and protein (64% DV), as well as a good source of minerals . Miso paste is also high in amino acids, the basic building blocks of protein. An excellent source of vitamin K and a decent source of riboflavin (38% DV), miso also provides small amounts of other vitamins. One major benefit of miso is its extremely high omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content. We believe Miso saves Burners life on the Playa and leave them with good health all day.",

Come down to the Paradise Motel to witness the twisted creations of our own mad scientists and dance to the mash-ups (music with lyrics!) of special guest DJ LobsterDust (Bootie, NYC) and resident DJs Poysyn and Joshy G. Since we always want more, diabolical cocktail concoctions and snow cones (ice cold like our souls) will be provided. The beautifully distorted creations we've made at our mutant animal parties in SF and LA will be up for \"adoption\" or bring a stuffed animal to help us make more! Fill out adoption papers for these mutant animals and one could be yours at the end of the Burn. (Return Sunday to pick up your adopted mutant) Special test tube surprise will be given to anyone wearing a lab coat, super villain, mutant or other evil creation outfit. Super heroes may attend at their own risk.",

She will share some useful tools that can maximize our experience, as well as what we can learn, in those inner voyages. Non- ordinary states of consciousness can come with their own sets of 'superpowers', operating principles and potential pitfalls. Knowing how to use those forces for expansion, and alignment, can not only occasionally save you from 'the inner gates of hell', but also bring accelerated growth, ecstatic experiences, and a deep feeling of connectedness with yourself, others, and the world. Through lecture, sharing, and experiential exercises she will enrich your psychonaut- toolkit, and activate and empower your inner shaman.",

    "description": "This offering will be a combination of lecture and dialogue on the topic of open (non-monogamous) relationship as a path of awakening. Open relationships, and/or polyamory, are becoming more widely known to the general public as an alternative to the default cultural model of monogamous relationships. One of the first questions that comes up for someone when they first hear about open relationship is \"Why?\" Why would anyone choose this model of relationship? Certainly at the beginning of someone's exploration of open relationship (and often for sometime to come), it would seem a guaranteed way to bring up ones deepest fears and insecurities. So why do it? \r\n\r\nWe will talk about open relationships and explore answers to these questions, from an unlikely frame, that of spiritual awakening. In my opinion, not only is open relationship compatible with a deep path of spiritual awakening, it may be one of the most profound ways to catalyze and walk that path.",

Take a walk through your house (or Burning Man camp) from plastic-packaged food in the kitchen to toothbrushes and shampoo in the bathroom, our world is full of plastic.  And at Burning Man, we are sleep in plastic sleeping bags in plastic tents and wear plastic goggles.  And how much of our food and water is packaged in plastic? Although some plastics make our lives better, much of it is a problem -- polluting our oceans and beaches and harming our health with toxic chemicals. But what can one person do to be part of the solution? Join us for inspiring stories and practical tips to reduce plastic in your home and on the Playa.  Author Beth Terry will share her journey from self-confessed plastic addict to empowered plastic-free activist and explain why we can't just recycle our way out of this mess.  You may even get to peek at her (nearly) plastic-free campsite.",

In the tradition of Terrence McKenna, we will get together and share our past voyages and impressions of the psychedelic experience.

Being monkeys, when we encounter a translinguistic object, a kind of cognitive dissonance is set up in our hindbrain. We try to pour language over it and it sheds it like water off a duck's back.\" We will push the envelope of language to see if we can go ahead and English some of that alien information after all. Perhaps art, music or dance will play a part in expressing these otherwise inexpressible concepts. All are welcome, whether experienced with the psychedelic state or not.

    "description": "Where have you been?  What have you seen? What did it mean? In the tradition of Terrence McKenna, we will get together and share our past voyages and impressions of the psychedelic experience. In the pschedelic state, to quote McKenna, \"One hears and beholds a language of alien meaning that is conveying alien information that cannot be Englished. Being monkeys, when we encounter a translinguistic object, a kind of cognitive dissonance is set up in our hindbrain. We try to pour language over it and it sheds it like water off a duck's back.\" We will push the envelope of language to see if we can go ahead and English some of that alien information after all. Perhaps art, music or dance will play a part in expressing these otherwise-inexpressible concepts. All are welcome, whether experienced with the psychedelic state or not. Please note: this is a discussion group only; illegal substances and activities are not welcome in our camp. Please respect our need to keep our camp safe and 100% legal. Thank you.",

Have you been wondering what is Rootism? Have you been wondering what is Rootist & PHY yoga? Well then, wonder no more:The Rootist understands that the path of oneness forks many roads. There are infinite possibilities from which we may choose along the way. It’s the journey.We will learn from our experiences as we evolve as humans, and we may hopefully learn to peel away the layers of illusion fostered by maturity and our life experiences. Through study and inquiry we may also find common threads from the ancient teachings linked to modern expressions of spirituality.We may even sense unity at some point.What is beautiful about life is that there are multiple unique levels of exploration within each of us. Each layer can reveal a different angle or new areas of focus for growth evolving us to become prismatic.Our potential is driven from the main spirit channel, the heart – the keeper of our spark. Our breathing, the spiritus from which the word spirit evolved, is feeding the spark.Self-Awareness happens when we identify and tap into the roots of our beliefs with evaluation and reflection.Rootism is the belief that the truth is all around us always yet often hidden like a gem in the rough waiting for us to discover it with great enthusiasm.",

The camp is \"Open\" and ready to accept your cans Monday through Sunday, 9am to 5pm. Bring your clean, separated aluminum cans only. We definitely don't want your trash. We also do not accept any other recyclables, you can take them to one of the 24 hour recycling stations on your way back to Reno, check out your Survival Guide for more information. We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. Then you can ride the bike powered can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV.

If you understand – really understand – then this year at Burning Man, we may just have an event worth crossing the playa for.\r\nBring a bottle of your favorite drop to the Mystikal Misfits bar (4:30 & B) at 2 pm, Wednesday, August 28th.   Come armed with a strong thirst (if not an obsession) for rare single malts – the kind of bottlings that spark rave reviews and win awards.  Nothing blended, nothing commonplace.  Caress to impress with a spectacular scotch you’d like to turn the playa onto.  Once inside our exclusive event – NO BOTTLE, NO ENTRY – you will partake of Scottish music and nibbles with like-minded desert kiltsmen and women.\r\nSo while spewing feathers in the heat of the day, don’t be a numpty and end up blustered from just any bad swally and scran…  Settle into a little Misfit hospitality and savor the kind of “cargo” cults were actually started over…  You know at least one of the scotches will be spectacular, because you’re going to bring it.\r\nAnd a dram good time will be had by all!\r\n\r\nEntry requires a bottle of unique single malt scotch (no blends) , where you'll join other like-minded fans for a once-in-a-playa tasting they'll write bagpipe songs about.",

Soul Retrieval can get at the base issue.  We all have stories of clearing dark energy, shielding ourselves, psychically intuitively knowing what needs to be done, and sense spirit helpers moving through us. Shamanista protocols make channeling routine. And sometimes we also have to rescue the lost child of the early trauma, in soul retrieval, to get them unstuck.",

Milton Bradley debuted Simon in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York, and it remains a sweetheart of memory games and an enduring pop-culture reference to the 1980’s. We look to revive this great game in a playa-compliant fashion, offering the core gameplay intact but adding (external) flame, sound and light effects in the form of nearby sculpture. Game play will take place on an original (but deeply repurposed and reengineered) Simon hand-held console, which is synchronized with the sculpture piece (light, sound, flame).

Milton Bradley debuted Simon in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York, and it remains a sweetheart of memory games and an enduring pop-culture reference to the 1980’s. We look to revive this great game in a playa-compliant fashion, offering the core gameplay intact but adding (external) flame, sound and light effects in the form of nearby sculpture. Game play will take place on an original (but deeply repurposed and reengineered) Simon hand-held console, which is synchronized with the sculpture piece (light, sound, flame). What the original game lacks, this project delivers: a win-condition with lighting, sound and flame effect display. Bluntly, we feel that a game of Simon to be passed around with a light, sound and flame effect display is a winning combination.",

Special attention will be paid to balancing out all the stimulation the Playa offers your nervous system. This soothing, grounding, mellow yoga practice will be accessible for yogis of all levels.  \r\n\r\nPlease bring a mat, as well as a sarong, towel, scarf or belt.\r\n\r\nWe'll meet behind the Temple, as to enjoy the peace it attracts as well as the beauty of the landscape beyond our fair city.\r\n\r\nBritt Fohrman fell in love with yoga in 1993 and has been teaching since 1997. While her foundation is rooted in the Iyengar lineage, a 10 year struggle with chronic illness inspired her to go deeply into Restorative Yoga, Viniyoga and Buddhism. Having studied therapeutic yoga and movement with many of the leaders in the field, Britt still believes it's her own healing journey, as well as that of her students, that has taught her the most. Along with her steadfast belief in the healing power of yoga, Britt brings resourcefulness and warmth to her classes. Her style of teaching emphasizes individualized alignment, meditative focus and breath guided movement; imbued with levity, compassion and honesty. She encourages you to step out of your head, into your body and on a yoga journey that supports you wherever you are. One of Britt's specialties lies in working with childbearing women, where she also employs her talents as a photographer, doula, childbirth educator and bodyworker. A passionate adventurer and athlete, Britt spends most of her free time traveling, surfing, hiking with her dog and dancing with the performance art group Billion Jelly Bloom. (Who she's camping and performing with on the Playa)\r\n\r\nFind out more about Britt and her practice at www.brittfohrman.com.",

    "description": "The now infamous camp challenge is back. With origins dating all the way back to the 1980s, this camping tradition has morphed into something truly monstrous. During the heat of the day, in triple digit temperatures, one must eat a helping of five-alarm chili, cooked with the dreaded Guatemalan insanity pepper (grown only by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum). Then, to wash it down, a shot of hot pepper vodka, also infused with the same insanely hot pepper. Now, when you want nothing more than an ice-cold beverage to quench the fire burning in your mouth, you instead must chug a cheap, warm beer that's been sitting out in the sun since daybreak. Why, might you ask, would anyone want to do this? Hell if we know! It's a terrible idea! It's a horrible thing to conceive, much less do on purpose! Yet, as demonstrated by the droves of people who participated AND completed the challenge in past years, we apparently underestimated human nature. Not only did crowds show up for the challenge, but they returned over the course of the week to to share the pain with their friends. And by share, we mean point and laugh while grown men cried and stumbled down the street in a daze. We even had a university anthropologist come hangout, just to observe this odd aspect of human behavior.  We're bringing it back spicier than ever for 2013!",

We've got 10,000 watts of juicy sound, some of the best real estate in Black Rock City, and a nighttime crowd just waiting to be whipped into a frenzy. All you have to do is wow our panel of judges and you too could be headlining Burning Man! For this contest we hearken back to that seminal masterpiece of talent programs: The Gong Show. Perhaps you remember the cringe-worthy showcase of questionable performances that critics could halt by striking a loud gong. This event is eerily similar, only ours has balls. Ovaries too. Giant, dusty gonads. Can you hang? Instead of a gong, DJs will wear a shock collar and get buzzed off stage by volts of harsh rejection if they fail to impress. Instead of regaling us with tap dancing, DJs break out their most mind blowing tracks and slickest tricks. Instead of a paltry sum to commemorate victory, winners will be invited back during peak hours to pound the dance floor into submission. This is open decks for the fearless. Bring it.",

    "description": "We offer spankings to all walks of life so long as you are 18 years of age or older (we reserve the right to ask for ID). We will have a variety of spanking stations and implements to use if bare handed is not your style. Once you have had your fill of spankings you may return to the street or you can come on back to the legendary Xanadome and chill out and relax. Have a drink if you'd like and a freshly baked cookie to reward yourself for a good spanking.  For the curious here is a quick FAQ on spanking.       1) How hard do I have to get spanked.  ANSWER: how hard do you want to be spanked?       2) How many swats do I need to receive to get a cookie?  ANSWER: At least one.    3) I am diabetic/not hungry/gluten intolerant/etc. and do not want a cookie, just a spanking is that okay?     ANSWER: Absolutely, you do not have to receive a cookie to get a spanking, but you must get a spanking to get a cookie.           4) Can I spank you?    ANSWER:  Ask us, we may or may not let you. Cuteness and snuggly bribery or swag works well.        5) I want my partner/friend to spank me instead of you, is that okay.     ANSWER: Of course. Please remember we want to keep you in your comfort zone.     6) Does it have to be bare bottom spanking or is that optional?    ANSWER:  That is completely up to your comfort zone. We will accommodate your limits.",

It is a simple, powerful moving meditation that anyone – of any age, size, or physical ability - can practice. There are no steps to follow, no choreography to learn, no way to do it wrong. The only requirement is a body that is still breathing, a heart that is still beating, and mind that is still curious! Just like light, sound or ocean waves, a dancing body when moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion. The 5Rhythms are: FLOWING – the fluid, continuous, grounded glide of our own movements STACCATO – the percussive, pulsing beat that shapes us a thousand different ways CHAOS – the rhythm of letting go, releasing into the catalytic wildness of our dance that can never be planned or repeated LYRICAL – the rhythm of trance, where the weight of self-consciousness dissolves, where we lighten up and disappear into our own uniqueness STILLNESS – the quiet emptiness, where gentle movements rise and fall, start and end, in a field of silence Please join RhythmWave as we return to the Black Rock City for our seventh year with this gorgeous dance/meditation practice that we love to share with you!",

All couples welcome. \r\nAll couples are invited to this playful exploration of intimate partnership and love as a spiritual practice and path to realization.   Harness the wisdom of the body and the physical sensations of love to deepen trust, strengthen communications, and create a powerful shared vision for your love relationship.   Discover ancient Yogic, Tantric, and Taoist exercises that will allow you to gain deep insight into your relationship and see your partner in a whole new light, whether you just met on the playa or renewing your vows on your 40th anniversary. You will experience your partner’s love and trust in a new and profound way. Learn how to use these powerful skills and movements to create a new and exciting level of intimacy that deepens the physical, spiritual, and emotional aspects of your sacred connection.  We will explore couple-hood as a yogic path to realization, letting go of the mind and surrendering to the heart through your lover. It is a practice of using your two-ness to realize oneness.  Yoga and Qigong are like brother and sister. Both are esoteric, alchemical practices that were created for self-realization, with exercise being a secondary benefit. Qigong is much gentler than most forms of yoga, and a wonderful compliment to a vigorous yoga practice. Both practices have a common source, Neolithic shamanic practices, and both are ancient books of wisdom written in the language of the body. We'll physically explore the connection between these 2 books of wisdom within the context of your love relationship. We are channeling the sexual and creative energies of the body through visualization, movement, ritual, and breath, not sexual activity. Tantric Qigong is an intimate practice of being gentle with oneself and weaving one's own sexual energy, becoming truly receptive.",

On a deeper level, it will draw on the very values of Burning Man, whose Ten Principles (radical inclusion, gifting, de-commodification, radical, self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation, and immediacy) will provide touchstones for the speakers in their talks.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is in the spirit of the 10 Principles, TEDxBlackRockCity aims to be more than merely a staged performance. For it is intended, above all, to foster creativity among all of its remarkable participants — both on stage and off — drawing on the uniquely dynamic community of Burning Man to concoct an exemplar of that fertile soup churning with creative sparks.\r\n\r\nPlease join us for an exciting day at Play)A(Skool and the new Aspire \"Learning Center\" --- a collaborative interactivity zone created by Play)A(Skool, IDEATE and La Calaca.",

Participants will learn how to access and sustain the energy, and be trained on how to give and receive energetic squeezes. This exchange of power contributes to aligning the Djed, invigorating the Chakras, and awakening the Kundalini. Participants will leave being present to their super powers and their connectedness to the Oneness. Come with a squeezing buddy or find one there.",

You’ll discover the possibility of reconnection with your innate beauty, wholeness and be honest with yourself and and with others in a safe circle of love. You can discover those places you’ve felt stuck, while you are supported in letting go. You learn to become aware of those times when you get in your own way, and come to see the choices open to you. You embrace what you desire the most, and deeply commit to letting your dreams and your visions be more important than you past wounds. You will find yourself reconnecting with your innate beauty, wholeness and power in each moment.\r\n\r\nHeart of Now workshops include numerous assistants to support you and to create a sacred space for transformation. A deeply nurturing environment is created. This teamwork approach deepens the experience of service and camaraderie, where all are able to experience their vulnerabilities, allowing trust and growth.

Three years ago we took everything we had learned and completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and we gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. This year we’ve taken it that much further with a singular goal of maximizing our guests’ overall pleasure, along with the comfort and sensuality of the environment. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, and deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience in an environment that is safe, comfortable and private, and which leaves you feeling completely respected and in control. Come solo, or better yet, bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and personal experience. You can wear as much or as little as you would like while riding this marvelous machine, and you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, the Orgasamator Experience at our I-Scream Parlour is something you won't want to miss.

This year we’ve taken it that much further with a singular goal of maximizing our guests’ overall pleasure, along with the comfort and sensuality of the environment. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience in an environment that is safe, comfortable and private, and which leaves you feeling completely respected and in control. Come solo, or better yet, bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. You can wear as much or as little as you would like while riding this marvelous machine, and you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, the Orgasamator Experience at our I-Scream Parlour is something you won't want to miss. Visit us at the Camp for Sensual Pleasures, in Spanky’s Village, and also ask about The Pope’s Massage & Hair washing.",

    "description": "There is nothing more basic intimate connection you can have with another person than touch. There are things which can be erotic, silly, or basic than the touch that leads to tickling. Tickling is a great way to explore a new avenue of fun and intimacy with your partner. It can be light, it can be soft, or it can be heavy and sadistic. \r\n\r\nWe will cover many aspects of tickling from playing with others, simple bondage techniques, wrestling, common toys you can use to make your partner cry out in fits of laughter, to discussions of how it can spice up your sex life.  We will cover some aspects of BDSM for the full spectrum of tickling fun.  In addition we will cover the proper etiquette for playing with someone new to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n There will also have a tickle challenge for the most ticklish man and woman attending the event. Those two will be tickled by our event  coordinators, the partner, and whomever else the person is comfortable with. The person who lasts the longest of tickle torment will win a cool prize and be crowned tickle king or queen of Black Rock City.\r\n\r\nYou must be 18 years of age or older to attend this event. This event is best suited for those with a partner. If you do not have a partner that does not mean you cannot attend. We cannot guarantee you will have a partner to play with, but we will try and match you up with someone or one of our instructors.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo be respectful of others and their boundaries. Just remember we are all here for fun, and we have at least two things in common. We are interested/curious about tickling and we are all burners.",

But not all values and qualities can be converted that easily into a pile of banknotes. After all, isn’t what we really value in life ‘priceless’?",

    "description": "\"Experiences of Transpersonal Phenomena Induced by Electronic Dance Music Events\" \r\n\r\nAudrey Katherine, PhD will be presenting her dissertation research which used qualitative and intuitive inquiry research methods to explore the types of transpersonal phenomena that people experience at electronic dance music (EDM) events and how these experiences integrate into day-to-day life. Twelve participants were interviewed and a thematic content analysis was conducted on the data, revealing the following overarching themes: Interpersonal relationships with the numinous, spiritual beings, and human beings are fostered; occurrence of transformative intrapersonal experiences; electronic dance music and its effects on the mind and body serve as a catalyst for experiences of transpersonal phenomena; experiences of a spiritual and mystical nature transpire; emphasis placed on the significance of set and setting. Findings suggest that having experiences of transpersonal phenomena at EDM events enhances health and wellbeing in day-to-day life.",

This structure, which will be combined with our wave sculpture, will be curated by the visualist CINEMOEBA, who, as per his 2012 work, will once again be providing a wonderland of analog feedback & other projected delights. This in combination with our live fusion and  Dubstep centric line-up featuring some of the finest bass culture talent available on playa, denizens of Black Rock City can expect a fourth dimensional EXPERIENCE like no other. Come wobble the TBE~WaVe~ and challenge your perceptions of bass culture music from every learning and thinking modality. Discover the optimal conditions for proper bass culture appreciation, the facilitation of which is our primary mission. We are devoted to ensuring the Tsunami Bass well~spring of proper bass culture on playa is properly nurtured and celebrated at Burning Man. As the TBE Multiversity of Bass Culture Appreciation founders will preach, proper edutainment is our main goal.  We invite you to open your heart/mind and try a new \"substance over style\" attuned environment, carefully curated by bass culture artists (Established by the Tsunami Bass Experience's Morphous & ShiZaru) for artists & aficionados. This is not a \"nightclub on playa\" but rather a welcome respite for those seeking low-end frequency with the utmost decency... join us for a more intimate and holistically immersive esthetic environment in which you will experience a full range of frequencies, with the decibels enlightenly engineered properly. Line-up will be posted to the internets so find us!! ~Cheers!~}*{~ (BYOB, NO MOOP)",

There is a rumor that we eat bunnies, and it is true, but only with their consent. They like it. It tickles. Then they turn into candy. In the Enchanted Forest we are always having big lovely orgies with our friends. We like orgies, and we are always horny!! At burningman we are having a stampede, taking our unbridled joy and annoyingly perky enthusiasm across the playa. Join us! We will be galloping around making a nuisance of ourselves, stampeding through people's camps spreading our intolerably positive energy throughout the festival. We will start at 6.30pm, and then stampede around who knows where as the sun sets. We will provide horns to those who are horn deficient. We really can't wait to meet you! Squeeeee!",

Most forms of energy healing, such as Reiki, utilize the energy of manifested life. However, Vortex makes use of divine light and energy, which is more powerful, and can work more deeply, than the energy of manifested life alone. Vortex utilizes 49 different kinds of divine light that serve various functions, including energizing, clearing, purifying, releasing, etc. Finally, all of these forms of divine light are guided by divine consciousness, which brings the deepest power of transformation, i.e. healing separation consciousness. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will feature two Omega-level practitioners of VortexHealing® Divine Energy Healing who will facilitate a small group healing on a topic to be determined at the time of the workshop. Space will be limited to about 15 people.",

Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right. With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy. In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.",

Anyone who has completed our daily quests, or just wants to hang out and get their fix is welcome. Our resident mad alchemist has come up with some special brews, and servings of delicious chocolate cake are available to all. If any of our \"Dragonbreath\" chili remains, it’s a great time to polish that off.

All manifestations of the feminine are invited to join in this practice that will help you tone, open and tune into the pelvic floor, while connecting us with the vast array of pleasurable possibilities in this yummy part of our bodies. In addition to igniting the strength, suppleness and juiciness of our bodies, we'll also gather inspiration from each other to manifest our most wild, uninhibited, embodied and instinctual selves, bringing that energy into in the ways we move, breathe, dance, create, connect and play on and off the Playa.\r\n\r\nPregnant women of the Playa are especially encouraged to join and will be given appropriate modifications to support their growing bellies and babies.\r\n\r\nNo yoga experience required. You are encouraged to bring a mat, as well as a sarong, towel or scarf.\r\n\r\nMeet behind the Temple (facing away from The Man).\r\n\r\nBritt Fohrman gathers her depth of knowledge of the female reproductive system from over 12 years of work as a birth doula, as well as her expertise as a yoga teacher trained mostly in the Iyengar linage since 1993. Her HypnoBirthing childbirth education training and experience in witnessing peace and ease in birth has inspired her to apply these principles of visualization, meditation, breathing and affirmations to other aspects of women's health, particularly fertility and pelvic health. Her teaching style is warm, patient and focused on supporting each student to connect to the voice and abilities of their own body. In addition to training teachers in yoga for women, Britt has a full yoga teaching schedule that includes all kinds of therapeutic private sessions, Prenatal and Gentle Hatha weekly classes and monthly Restorative Yoga workshops. To view her schedule and to learn more about Britt and her practice, please visit: www.brittfohrman.com.",
