# Camp Image Collection Project

## Overview

This subproject aims to significantly expand the image coverage for Burning Man theme camps by automatically discovering, downloading, and curating images from camp websites and other online sources.

## Current State

The BRC Domesday application currently has limited image coverage:
- Most camps have **zero images**
- Some camps have **one image** (when `camps.json` contains a `thumbnail_url`)
- Images are only available when explicitly provided in the camp data from the Burning Man API

## Project Goals

1. **Discover camp images** from multiple sources:
   - Primary: Camp websites (from the `url` field in `camps.json`)
   - Future: Web galleries, social media, photo archives, etc.

2. **Download candidate images** automatically while:
   - Being respectful of servers (rate limiting)
   - Filtering for likely camp-related images (not generic site elements)
   - Supporting interruption and resumption

3. **Human curation workflow** to review and approve images:
   - Simple web-based interface
   - Quick approve/reject decisions
   - Build final curated image dataset

## Architecture

### Component 1: Image Scraper Script

**Purpose**: Discover and download candidate images from camp websites

**Key Features**:
- **Resumability**: Can be interrupted and restarted at any time
- **Progress tracking**: Maintains state of which camps have been processed
- **Rate limiting**: Respectful delays between requests
- **Smart filtering**: Download only images likely to be camp photos (not logos, icons, buttons)
- **Metadata tracking**: Record source URL, download date, camp association

**Input**:
- `campHistory.json` containing camp names and website URLs
- Note that camps may have been coming to Burning Man for one or more years, and may have different URLs for each year, but it's all the same camp.

**Output**:
- Downloaded images organized by camp
- Metadata JSON file tracking download status and image sources (keep original page URL where the image came from so we can go back there)

**Implementation Considerations**:
- May run for hours or days depending on number of camps
- Should handle network failures gracefully
- Should respect `robots.txt`
- Should identify and skip non-photo images (small icons, UI elements, etc.)
- Should handle various website structures (static pages, galleries, etc.)
- Set a limit of about 100 images per camp
- Many camps have Instagram or Facebook URLs. **These may require special consideration** for downloading images. For now, store a list of all the camps with Facebook or Instagram URLs, but we won't attempt to download those images until a future update.

### Component 2: Image Curation Web App

**Purpose**: Allow human review and approval of candidate images

**Key Features**:
- **Simple UI**: Show all the uncurated candidate images for one camp at a time with camp context and where the image came from 
- **Quick decisions**: Keyboard shortcuts or mouse click to remove images from the list that are not appropriate
- **Progress tracking**: Show how many images reviewed, remaining
- **Context display**: Show camp name, year, source URL
- **Resume capability**: Remember which images have been reviewed

**Workflow**:
1. Find the next camp that has more than one image in the candidates directory
2. Display to the user a page containing: 
      1. the name of the camp and a link to its 2025 URL
      2. the 2025 description of the camp
      3. all the candidate images that were downloaded, in three columns
3. Images are assumed to be accepted. The user clicks on any image that they want to exclude. When they do so, that image appears 50% transparent with a red 🚫 in the corner. If they click by mistake, they can click again to re-accept the image.
4. There is also a button called Reject All which applies the 🚫 to every image in the set. There is also a button called Accept All which removes all the 🚫 from every image.
5. When the user is finished reviewing the images, they click on a submit button at the top or bottom of the page. 

**Output**:
- Update the scraper/download_state.json file to add a new field for the camp "last_curated": "timestamp" which can be used to see that the camp has been curated since it was last downloaded by the scraper. (That way if the scraper scrapes again, we'll know that it needs to be curated again)
- Update the metadata.json file in the candidates/[camp name] subfolder to mark each image by adding "curated_date" with the timestamp of the curation and "curation_result" with "approved" or "rejected"

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Image Discovery and Download

1. Run scraper script: `python scraper/scrape_images.py`
2. Script processes camps one at a time:
   - Check `download_state.json` to see if already processed
   - Visit camp website URL
   - Parse HTML to find image URLs
   - Filter out small/icon images
   - Download promising images to `candidates/[camp_uid]/`
   - Update `download_state.json`
3. Script can be interrupted (Ctrl+C) and resumed safely

### Phase 2: Human Curation

1. Open curator web app: `file:///.../images/curator/index.html`
2. App loads candidate images from `candidates/` directory
3. For each camp not-yet-curated camp:
   - Display camps images
   - Show camp name and source
   - User clicks on any images that should be deleted

### Phase 3: Integration

1. Integrate approved images into main BRC Domesday app
2. Update image loading logic to check local approved images
3. Fall back to API thumbnail URLs when available

## Image Selection Heuristics

### For Scraper (Automatic Filtering)

**Include images likely to be**:
- Photos of camps, art installations, structures
- Gallery or photo album images
- Large images (e.g., > 400px in either dimension)
- Image filenames suggesting camp/playa content

**Exclude images likely to be**:
- Site navigation elements (< 100px)
- Social media icons
- Logos, badges
- Background patterns
- Advertisement images

### For Human Curator (Manual Review)

**Approve images that**:
- Clearly show the camp or camp activities
- Are good quality and well-lit
- Represent the camp's character/theme
- Would be useful for users browsing the map

**Reject images that**:
- Don't show the camp
- Are too dark, blurry, or low quality
- Are primarily of people (privacy concerns)
- Are generic stock photos
- Contain inappropriate content

## Technical Considerations

### Scraper Implementation

**Python libraries**:
- `requests` - HTTP requests
- `beautifulsoup4` - HTML parsing
- `pillow` - Image analysis (size, format)
- `urllib.parse` - URL handling

**Key challenges**:
- Handling JavaScript-rendered galleries (may need Selenium/Playwright)
- Distinguishing camp photos from generic website images
- Managing storage (thousands of images)
- Respecting rate limits and bandwidth

### Curator Implementation

**Technology**:
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no build required)
- Local file access (may need local server for security)
- JSON for state management

**Key challenges**:
- Loading images from local filesystem
- Efficiently handling large numbers of images
- Keyboard shortcuts for speed
- Saving review state reliably

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional image sources**:
   - Flickr galleries tagged with camp names
   - Instagram posts (if API available)
   - Burning Man's official photo archives
   - User submissions

2. **Automated quality filtering**:
   - ML-based camp photo detection
   - Automatic duplicate detection
   - Image quality scoring

3. **Multi-image support**:
   - Image carousels in the main app
   - Year-specific images (camp looked different in different years)

4. **Crowd-sourced curation**:
   - Allow multiple reviewers
   - Voting/consensus on image quality
   - Community contributions

## Success Metrics

- **Coverage**: Percentage of camps with at least one image
- **Quality**: Average number of good images per camp
- **Efficiency**: Time to curate 100 images
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of auto-downloaded images that pass human review

## Timeline Estimate

- **Scraper development**: 2-3 days
- **Initial scraping run**: 1-2 days (continuous)
- **Curator app development**: 1-2 days
- **Human curation**: Variable (depends on volume and reviewer time)
- **Integration**: 1 day

## Q&A

1. How many images per camp should we aim for? 
A: For now let's cut it off at 128 images per camp. 

2. What image formats and sizes should we store?
A: We will store the original PNG, JPEG, without changing anything. Do not download any animations or videos.

3. Should we resize images for faster loading?
A: If any image is > 25MB, the curation step should resize it if approved. 

4. How do we handle copyright/attribution?
A: When the image is downloaded, store the URL of the page from whence it was downloaded along with the URL of the image itself, and also a link to any copyright notices that appeared on the original web site. 

5. Should we cache website content to avoid re-downloading?
A: Absolutely!

6. What's the process for updating images annually?
A: For now let's assume this is a one time thing. There will be a future enhancement where we will rerun the scraper once a year and it will only look for new pictures.
